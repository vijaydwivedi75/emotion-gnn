Ses03F_script01_1_F000 [003.2570-010.0721]: What's he going to say? Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.
Ses03F_script01_1_M000 [008.9773-012.3712]: He saw it.
Ses03F_script01_1_F001 [011.6048-016.5588]: What-how did he see it? I mean
Ses03F_script01_1_M001 [015.9019-018.0915]: He was out there when it happened.
Ses03F_script01_1_F002 [017.5989-019.5969]: When?
Ses03F_script01_1_M002 [019.0221-028.3005]: Um
Ses03F_script01_1_F003 [027.5250-029.8059]: What was he doing out at four in the morning?
Ses03F_script01_1_M003 [029.3175-035.0335]: I don't know. But after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen.
Ses03F_script01_1_F004 [034.2398-036.7304]: Did you talk to him?
Ses03F_script01_1_M004 [036.0188-041.8486]: No

Ses03F_script01_1_F006 [047.3773-056.3547]: What was he doing out there at that time? He was dreaming about him again. He's walking around at night again.
Ses03F_script01_1_M006 [055.2873-058.6264]: I guess he is.
Ses03F_script01_1_F007 [058.8453-062.8961]: Could he-he's acting just like he did after he died

Ses03F_script01_1_M009 [075.1852-080.8234]: Being dishonest with him. That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.
Ses03F_script01_1_F010 [080.0844-083.0500]: What do you mean
Ses03F_script01_1_M010 [082.4656-089.2533]: You know Larry's not coming back and I know that too. Why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?
Ses03F_script01_1_F011 [088.2406-091.1145]: What
Ses03F_script01_1_M011 [089.7734-097.5550]: No

Ses03F_script01_1_M012 [098.5044-101.4877]: We got to tell him that.
Ses03F_script01_1_F013 [100.6119-107.0438]: We can't. It just won't work.
Ses03F_script01_1_M013 [114.5431-122.2615]: You know
Ses03F_script01_1_F014 [121.1393-124.3416]: They do come back.
Ses03F_script01_1_F015 [124.4237-127.7628]: I know
Ses03F_script01_1_F016 [128.1460-132.0325]: Three years has been a long time.
Ses03F_script01_1_M014 [131.1841-136.4665]: All right. Just- Sit down
Ses03F_script01_1_F017 [136.6033-145.9638]: It's those Goddamn newspapers
Ses03F_script01_1_M015 [144.4585-148.5913]: All right. All right. Just come on
Ses03F_script01_1_F018 [149.0566-152.1494]: What?
Ses03F_script01_1_M016 [151.1367-155.3100]: You know-you know why I asked Annie here
Ses03F_script01_1_F019 [153.9832-156.7749]: Why?
Ses03F_script01_1_M017 [155.8717-158.3350]: You know.
Ses03F_script01_1_F020 [157.4044-162.3858]: Well
Ses03F_script01_1_M018 [161.7563-166.1355]: I want to ask her to marry me.
Ses03F_script01_1_F021 [165.9165-170.9252]: Well
Ses03F_script01_1_M019 [169.4198-172.5948]: Come on
Ses03F_script01_1_F022 [171.9653-177.5761]: Well
Ses03F_script01_1_M020 [176.7276-181.3805]: So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it.
Ses03F_script01_1_F023 [180.5868-187.1282]: Well
Ses03F_script01_1_M021 [182.5574-186.7450]: See
Ses03F_script01_1_M022 [186.7724-193.1475]: -Oh
Ses03F_script01_1_M023 [193.2043-197.4467]: God. You have such a talent for ignoring things.
Ses03F_script01_1_F024 [196.6803-200.1015]: Yeah
Ses03F_script01_1_F025 [200.1836-205.8492]: And she-she's Larry's girl.
Ses03F_script01_1_M024 [204.2344-207.9020]: No
Ses03F_script01_1_F026 [207.0261-214.8813]: Well
Ses03F_script01_1_F027 [214.9360-220.5742]: If you go on from that point
Ses03F_script01_1_F028 [220.6525-225.0082]: 'Cause listen
Ses03F_script01_1_M025 [223.8860-227.0883]: Oh
Ses03F_script01_1_F029 [225.0355-227.5262]: What do you want from me?
Ses03F_script01_1_M026 [227.2850-239.2132]: Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life
Ses03F_script01_1_F030 [238.5837-242.8534]: You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that.
Ses03F_script01_1_M027 [241.4301-244.2766]: To hell with that.
Ses03F_script01_1_F031 [244.2492-247.3694]: There's nothing wrong with it.
Ses03F_script01_1_M028 [251.2833-255.3614]: I didn't ask Annie yet.
Ses03F_script01_1_F032 [254.1571-258.2079]: You didn't ask her yet?
Ses03F_script01_1_M029 [257.4963-260.8175]: I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses03F_script01_1_F033 [260.3400-264.6275]: Well
Ses03F_script01_1_M030 [264.1400-270.7175]: Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.
Ses03F_script01_1_M031 [270.7975-276.2850]: I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad
Ses03F_script01_1_M032 [276.3542-279.3101]: Mom
Ses03F_script01_1_F034 [278.4343-283.9904]: You know
Ses03F_script01_1_M033 [283.1693-286.4537]: So what? I'm not fast with women.
Ses03F_script01_1_F035 [285.3589-290.2581]: I don't understand why it has to be her.
Ses03F_script01_1_M034 [288.7527-292.4203]: Because it is.
Ses03F_script01_1_F036 [292.2561-298.1406]: That's a good answer
Ses03F_script01_1_M035 [298.1680-301.0418]: I just-
Ses03F_script01_1_F037 [298.9343-304.2988]: I mean
Ses03F_script01_1_M036 [303.7514-307.6380]: It just is. I-
Ses03F_script01_1_M037 [307.8569-318.8596]: I grew up with her. Okay. All these years
Ses03F_script01_1_F038 [316.9711-320.2008]: No
Ses03F_script01_1_F039 [320.2550-331.3951]: He thinks he's coming back. You go-go on and marry her
Ses03F_script01_1_M038 [330.0813-333.4478]: Okay. All right
Ses03F_script01_1_F040 [333.7215-339.8798]: Just
Ses03F_script01_1_M039 [339.1134-342.7526]: No
Ses03F_script01_1_M040 [342.7800-351.2383]: And I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.
Ses03F_script01_1_M041 [351.3204-355.1795]: But if I can't have that here then I'll get out.
Ses03F_script01_1_F041 [354.6595-357.4786]: What the hell is this?
Ses03F_script01_1_M042 [356.9038-362.9800]: I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York.
Ses03F_script01_1_F042 [361.3378-364.7316]: You're crazy.
Ses03F_script01_1_M043 [364.5674-369.0014]: I've been a sucker too long. I'm through with it.
Ses03F_script01_1_F043 [368.2897-374.2837]: You're what-you're going to leave the business? But you can't do that. What the hell is this?
Ses03F_script01_1_M044 [372.8605-376.8292]: The business. The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses03F_script01_1_F044 [375.8438-378.4987]: Oh
Ses03F_script01_1_M045 [377.8966-393.3475]: Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.
Ses03F_script01_1_M046 [393.4153-396.3876]: Now
Ses03F_script01_1_M047 [396.4150-399.4641]: Now
Ses03F_script01_1_F045 [399.1904-401.7358]: Tell me something.
Ses03F_script01_1_F046 [401.8550-404.0125]: You'd leave that business.
Ses03F_script01_1_M048 [403.4327-407.4835]: Yes. On this I would.
Ses03F_script01_1_F047 [406.5803-410.6858]: You can't do that.
Ses03F_script01_1_M049 [410.2205-413.9975]: Then help me stay here.
Ses03F_script01_1_F048 [412.9848-418.8146]: All right
Ses03F_script01_1_M050 [418.8694-422.0990]: Okay. Just-
Ses03F_script01_1_F049 [420.4294-426.7245]: We've worked all our lives for you. Only for you
Ses03F_script01_1_M051 [425.2466-429.5163]: Yeah
Ses03F_script01_1_F050 [429.2152-431.8974]: I'm going to.
Ses03F_script01_1_F051 [432.1164-435.8935]: You just can't talk like that.
Ses03F_script01_1_M052 [434.9629-438.9589]: I am thinking like that.
Ses03F_script01_1_F052 [439.9716-444.4055]: I don't know you
Ses03F_script01_1_M053 [443.4749-449.0858]: No
Ses03F_script01_1_F053 [448.5110-453.2734]: Yeah. I can see that.
Ses03F_script01_2_F000 [006.9026-009.7483]: Why did you invite her here?
Ses03F_script01_2_M000 [008.9019-011.7622]: Why? Does that bother you?
Ses03F_script01_2_F001 [011.1850-015.8191]: She's been in New York for three-and-a-half years. She don't just suddenly come and-
Ses03F_script01_2_M001 [015.3375-018.7450]: Well
Ses03F_script01_2_F002 [018.2825-021.4083]: You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see.
Ses03F_script01_2_M002 [021.2186-031.1858]: What do you mean? They lived next door to each other their entire lives. Why shouldn't he want to see her? Hey
Ses03F_script01_2_F003 [031.3317-034.0753]: He's not going to marry her.
Ses03F_script01_2_M003 [033.5925-036.3080]: How do you know he's even thinking about it?
Ses03F_script01_2_F004 [035.4616-037.3442]: It's got that about it.
Ses03F_script01_2_M004 [036.7550-039.4018]: Well
Ses03F_script01_2_F005 [040.6075-042.7145]: What's going on here
Ses03F_script01_2_M005 [042.0286-044.6116]: Listen
Ses03F_script01_2_F006 [043.4004-047.9389]: She's not Larry's girl. She knows that.
Ses03F_script01_2_M006 [047.3697-050.2592]: You can't read her mind.
Ses03F_script01_2_F007 [049.5295-055.3231]: Then why is she married? Then why isn't she married? She's been in New York and there's hundreds of single men there.
Ses03F_script01_2_F008 [055.4106-059.7302]: I'm sure hundreds of them asked her and told her that she's foolish
Ses03F_script01_2_F009 [059.8324-062.1235]: She's waited.
Ses03F_script01_2_M007 [062.2403-065.1005]: How do you know why she's waited?
Ses03F_script01_2_F010 [065.3924-068.8072]: Because she thinks like me
Ses03F_script01_2_F011 [069.9017-076.9065]: She's faithful as a rock
Ses03F_script01_2_F012 [077.8075-082.4175]: I think again
Ses03F_script01_2_M008 [083.3475-087.6200]: Look
Ses03F_script01_2_F013 [087.1275-095.5300]: Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers
Ses03F_script01_2_M009 [094.0900-095.9200]: Calm yourself.
Ses03F_script01_2_F014 [095.5800-100.5600]: Because he's not coming back. Then what do I got to live for? I'll kill myself.
Ses03F_script01_2_M010 [100.2250-101.8700]: Calm yourself.
Ses03F_script01_2_F015 [100.5600-103.1100]: Don't
Ses03F_script01_2_F016 [103.2100-110.4800]: Look at it. Because why
Ses03F_script01_2_M011 [109.5200-112.0700]: All right. All right. Calm yourself.
Ses03F_script01_2_F017 [111.3200-115.9050]: You got to believe
Ses03F_script01_2_M012 [114.6900-117.1800]: Okay. Just calm yourself.
Ses03F_script01_2_F018 [116.8200-118.5000]: No
Ses03F_script01_2_F019 [118.6000-122.4532]: Believe
Ses03F_script01_2_M013 [121.6800-124.5400]: Why me
Ses03F_script01_2_M014 [126.1900-127.8200]: Huh?
Ses03F_script01_2_M015 [127.9300-130.8225]: Why me above all?
Ses03F_script01_2_F020 [130.1700-132.6600]: You got to keep believing.
Ses03F_script01_2_M016 [132.6100-135.3700]: Look at you
Ses03F_script01_2_F021 [135.2300-137.1600]: I can't help it.
Ses03F_script01_2_M017 [135.5300-137.6600]: What have I got to hide?
Ses03F_script01_2_M018 [137.7000-140.5600]: Huh? What the hell's the matter with you
Ses03F_script01_2_F000 [006.9026-009.7483]: Why did you invite her here?
Ses03F_script01_2_M000 [008.9019-011.7622]: Why? Does that bother you?

Ses03F_script01_3_F000 [006.9486-010.4025]: You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.
Ses03F_script01_3_M000 [009.6272-014.6199]: Yeah. I know. It went out of style
Ses03F_script01_3_F001 [014.0722-017.7377]: No
Ses03F_script01_3_F002 [019.7179-024.3946]: It's really lovely here. The air is sweet.
Ses03F_script01_3_M001 [024.1418-027.3860]: You're not sorry you came?
Ses03F_script01_3_F003 [026.7750-030.6091]: No. I'm not sorry. It's-
Ses03F_script01_3_F004 [031.0304-033.8111]: I can't stay.
Ses03F_script01_3_M002 [032.9895-035.6649]: Why not?
Ses03F_script01_3_F005 [035.7150-040.3800]: Well

Ses03F_script01_3_F007 [045.9125-050.2216]: you've been acting kind of
Ses03F_script01_3_M004 [049.6528-051.9069]: What?
Ses03F_script01_3_F008 [051.7594-055.8252]: Well

Ses03F_script01_3_M007 [083.7589-087.0452]: How did you know?
Ses03F_script01_3_F010 [081.2309-084.4751]: Yeah
Ses03F_script01_3_M008 [090.7528-096.1668]: Well
Ses03F_script01_3_M009 [096.2300-102.0864]: I
Ses03F_script01_3_F011 [086.0762-087.9089]: Well
Ses03F_script01_3_M010 [104.8461-107.7111]: Oh
Ses03F_script01_3_F012 [087.9300-091.2584]: from her opinion
Ses03F_script01_3_M011 [107.7532-109.8387]: Annie
Ses03F_script01_3_M012 [109.9441-113.0829]: I love you a great deal.
Ses03F_script01_3_M013 [114.3047-121.4040]: I-I love you. I have no imagination. That's all I know how to tell it.
Ses03F_script01_3_F013 [101.8757-105.4359]: Well
Ses03F_script01_3_M014 [121.5304-133.6645]: I'm embarrassing you. I didn't want to tell you it here. I wanted to go somewhere that would be brand-new to each other. It feels wrong here
Ses03F_script01_3_M015 [133.7066-138.1825]: I don't want to win you from anybody. I want you to be ready for me.
Ses03F_script01_3_F014 [137.6400-142.0699]: I've been ready for a long
Ses03F_script01_3_M016 [141.7118-146.9783]: Then he's gone forever. You're sure?
Ses03F_script01_3_F015 [144.8500-146.6525]: Look
Ses03F_script01_3_F016 [146.7300-150.0329]: I was almost married two years ago.
Ses03F_script01_3_M017 [149.0428-151.6128]: Why didn't you?
Ses03F_script01_3_F017 [152.2025-154.7625]: 'Cause you started to write me.
Ses03F_script01_3_M018 [153.9512-156.5844]: You felt something that far back?
Ses03F_script01_3_F018 [155.3925-157.4675]: Every day since.
Ses03F_script01_3_M019 [156.9050-159.3400]: Why didn't you let me know?
Ses03F_script01_3_F019 [158.8125-165.3058]: Well
Ses03F_script01_3_F020 [165.4525-168.0655]: You always can be so ambiguous.
Ses03F_script01_3_M020 [166.8436-169.2873]: Give me a kiss
Ses03F_script01_3_M021 [169.4425-171.1525]: Give me-
Ses03F_script01_3_M022 [172.8475-186.2666]: [LAUGHTER]. God
Ses03F_script01_3_F021 [186.2034-196.7365]: I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.
Ses03F_script01_3_M023 [196.6101-203.1616]: We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.
Ses03F_script01_3_F022 [203.5619-207.9226]: Not like that
Ses03F_script01_3_M024 [206.9114-209.3129]: I kissed you.
Ses03F_script01_3_F023 [208.1754-214.7901]: Like Larry's brother. Do it like you
Ses03F_script01_3_F024 [215.8645-219.6564]: What is it?
Ses03F_script01_3_M025 [219.7196-224.0125]: Let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you.
Ses03F_script01_3_F025 [223.4550-227.1981]: No. What is it? Is it your mother?
Ses03F_script01_3_M026 [226.3344-230.0841]: No
Ses03F_script01_3_F026 [229.1361-235.0347]: Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean
Ses03F_script01_3_M027 [233.9814-242.6817]: Yeah. I guess there is. I guess I was
Ses03F_script01_3_F027 [242.9345-246.3472]: You should tell me.
Ses03F_script01_3_M028 [245.2517-248.2431]: I don't know where to start.
Ses03F_script01_3_F028 [247.6743-251.8454]: But
Ses03F_script01_3_M029 [253.2779-259.2186]: You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company.
Ses03F_script01_3_F029 [258.1442-260.0823]: Yeah
Ses03F_script01_3_M030 [259.6820-262.0525]: Well
Ses03F_script01_3_F030 [261.9782-264.5272]: How many?
Ses03F_script01_3_M031 [263.5792-266.6760]: Just about all.
Ses03F_script01_3_F031 [266.0440-269.3724]: Geez.
Ses03F_script01_3_M032 [268.1600-274.7232]: It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men.
Ses03F_script01_3_M033 [274.7654-285.4669]: For instance
Ses03F_script01_3_M034 [285.5301-300.3818]: I mean
Ses03F_script01_3_M035 [300.6556-306.7648]: And I
Ses03F_script01_3_M036 [306.8325-320.1207]: Everything was being destroyed
Ses03F_script01_3_M037 [320.2050-331.3279]: And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.
Ses03F_script01_3_M038 [331.3911-342.5350]: And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.
Ses03F_script01_3_M039 [342.5982-356.8225]: And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.
Ses03F_script01_3_M040 [356.8600-376.6975]: And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car
Ses03F_script01_3_M041 [376.7750-381.1071]: Otherwise
Ses03F_script01_3_M042 [381.1703-384.0985]: And I didn't want to take any of it.
Ses03F_script01_3_M043 [384.1825-387.8904]: And I guess that included you.
Ses03F_script01_3_F032 [388.0379-391.4295]: And you still feel that way?
Ses03F_script01_3_M044 [390.9661-393.9364]: I want you now
Ses03F_script01_3_F033 [393.3676-401.9525]: Because you can't feel that way
Ses03F_script01_3_F034 [402.0150-410.2837]: I mean
Ses03F_script01_3_M045 [409.7570-412.3271]: Annie
Ses03F_script01_3_M046 [412.4925-415.8030]: Annie
Ses03F_script01_3_F035 [414.7775-419.3842]: What am I going to do with a fortune?
Ses03F_script02_1_M000 [002.7700-011.2400]: Hey
Ses03F_script02_1_M001 [011.3000-014.6600]: Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.
Ses03F_script02_1_M002 [014.6975-024.2225]: You know actually
Ses03F_script02_1_F000 [024.0358-025.2521]: Fine.
Ses03F_script02_1_M003 [024.9100-033.1075]: Oh
Ses03F_script02_1_M004 [033.2025-040.2425]: Oh
Ses03F_script02_1_M005 [040.2825-047.7946]: Oh
Ses03F_script02_1_F001 [046.8027-048.5436]: What flashlight?
Ses03F_script02_1_M006 [048.0400-053.4627]: Uh- you know
Ses03F_script02_1_F002 [052.3898-057.2685]: That's not your flashlight; it's ours. It's mine too.
Ses03F_script02_1_M007 [056.0944-059.5155]: Oh
Ses03F_script02_1_F003 [060.2038-067.7950]: I don't understand why you're always saying oh
Ses03F_script02_1_M008 [066.6800-076.1075]: No
Ses03F_script02_1_M009 [076.1600-080.3025]: We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it.
Ses03F_script02_1_M010 [080.3950-084.0707]: I hope the moon stays out.
Ses03F_script02_1_M011 [084.1517-090.8522]: Hey
Ses03F_script02_1_F004 [090.0830-092.7956]: Yes.
Ses03F_script02_1_M012 [091.7430-095.2100]: Are you cold? Do you want my jacket?
Ses03F_script02_1_M013 [095.3325-100.5770]: We should have brought the blanket. Oh
Ses03F_script02_1_M014 [100.7513-109.7650]: You know what would be good right now? A six-pack. Ah
Ses03F_script02_1_M015 [109.8300-119.8003]: I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER].
Ses03F_script02_1_M016 [119.8850-125.7923]: I wonder if they can hear us talk. Or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move.
Ses03F_script02_1_F005 [125.2052-128.0596]: I'm cold.
Ses03F_script02_1_M017 [127.4725-130.2863]: Do you want my jacket?
Ses03F_script02_1_F006 [129.3956-132.3714]: It's past eleven
Ses03F_script02_1_M018 [131.7034-139.0517]: What? Are you kidding me? We just got here. We'd miss it. What's the point of coming down there if we just turn around and go home?
Ses03F_script02_1_F007 [138.0800-140.5700]: There is no point in coming down here.
Ses03F_script02_1_M019 [139.8817-141.6834]: Right.
Ses03F_script02_1_F008 [140.8129-143.0599]: That's my point.
Ses03F_script02_1_M020 [142.1085-144.4425]: Yeah
Ses03F_script02_1_F009 [144.1000-145.8332]: Well
Ses03F_script02_1_M021 [145.2867-152.2425]: No. No
Ses03F_script02_1_M022 [152.2900-155.2425]: I mean
Ses03F_script02_1_F010 [154.4974-157.2303]: Not particularly.
Ses03F_script02_1_M023 [156.3396-158.5056]: Why not?
Ses03F_script02_1_F011 [157.9000-160.6514]: I don't know. I just don't.
Ses03F_script02_1_M024 [160.3477-179.5650]: Honey
Ses03F_script02_1_F012 [179.0875-185.6825]: Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.
Ses03F_script02_1_M025 [185.2150-196.9325]: Yeah. But that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. And all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you-spawning or mating or something like that.
Ses03F_script02_1_M026 [197.0075-201.4950]: I mean
Ses03F_script02_1_F013 [200.9650-207.7425]: I don't know why you're getting so excited. I mean
Ses03F_script02_1_M027 [207.2725-209.3250]: Yeah
Ses03F_script02_1_F014 [208.8600-211.0870]: Oh
Ses03F_script02_1_M028 [210.6550-220.4625]: What
Ses03F_script02_1_M029 [220.5110-230.2076]: There's magic here and mystery and a little bit of the unexplainable. I mean
Ses03F_script02_1_F015 [230.3450-235.0458]: I'm just not. I mean
Ses03F_script02_1_M030 [235.0053-237.2725]: For real?
Ses03F_script02_1_F016 [236.5033-238.8920]: Yes.
Ses03F_script02_1_M031 [238.8920-245.8625]: I don't get it. The last time-the first time that we came to see it you said it was the best night of your life.
Ses03F_script02_1_M032 [245.8950-253.3660]: And then last year when we came to see it you ran out of the house so fast that you stubbed your toe. And you didn't even notice until you got in the car.
Ses03F_script02_1_F017 [252.4348-262.5768]: Yes
Ses03F_script02_1_M033 [263.6497-266.4875]: We weren't in a good spot.
Ses03F_script02_1_F018 [265.8900-271.4636]: No
Ses03F_script02_1_M034 [270.1800-277.0913]: We just weren't in a good spot
Ses03F_script02_1_M035 [277.3949-282.0900]: no
Ses03F_script02_1_M036 [282.2533-290.5329]: I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean
Ses03F_script02_1_M037 [290.5800-303.2862]: Somewhere out there there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way. They don't know why. And we don't know why. Just some little instinctual time-release firecracker went off-went off in their bodies.
Ses03F_script02_1_M038 [303.3267-314.3188]: And they all
Ses03F_script02_1_M039 [314.3795-327.0721]: You know
Ses03F_script02_1_M040 [327.1329-335.1200]: its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know
Ses03F_script02_1_M041 [335.1725-344.9875]: They don't ask it a question. They just
Ses03F_script02_1_M042 [345.0483-354.9200]: where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death. Oh
Ses03F_script02_1_F019 [354.5125-356.6477]: Yeah
Ses03F_script02_1_M043 [356.2900-359.0375]: So what do you think?
Ses03F_script02_1_F020 [359.2950-360.9400]: About what?
Ses03F_script02_1_M044 [360.6350-362.9500]: About what I just said.
Ses03F_script02_1_F021 [363.0244-364.9109]: It's ridiculous.
Ses03F_script02_2_M000 [005.6500-009.4900]: So what do you think?
Ses03F_script02_2_F000 [008.5564-011.2227]: About what?
Ses03F_script02_2_M001 [010.3501-013.5496]: About what I was just saying.
Ses03F_script02_2_F001 [012.8467-015.9250]: It's ridiculous.
Ses03F_script02_2_M002 [014.9555-022.0332]: It certainly is not. It is slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
Ses03F_script02_2_F002 [021.5000-029.1595]: It's so P.R. I mean
Ses03F_script02_2_M003 [028.3112-031.6319]: Well
Ses03F_script02_2_F003 [030.3957-039.7762]: Exactly. Everyone else is told the same thing. It keeps them feeling excited. Keeps them coming back. Keeps them thinking life's going to start at any minute now.
Ses03F_script02_2_M004 [038.7097-041.9475]: Are we talking about the same thing?
Ses03F_script02_2_F004 [041.3517-044.5270]: I don't care. It's still fish to me.
Ses03F_script02_2_M005 [043.6787-051.4836]: Carla
Ses03F_script02_2_F005 [050.8534-057.2675]: Augie
Ses03F_script02_2_M006 [056.7750-059.7491]: Okay
Ses03F_script02_2_F006 [058.6826-066.7057]: Look
Ses03F_script02_2_M007 [065.8574-078.3647]: There's nothing to it
Ses03F_script02_2_F007 [077.4436-080.7886]: It's not like that.
Ses03F_script02_2_M008 [082.9701-086.2908]: We're not seeing the grunions?
Ses03F_script02_2_F008 [085.8303-090.9205]: Look
Ses03F_script02_2_M009 [090.1206-093.9988]: We missed them twice. That's not ever.
Ses03F_script02_2_F009 [092.7384-096.8590]: Twice is as many times as we've tried. That's ever.
Ses03F_script02_2_M010 [095.8168-098.4346]: We'll see them this time.
Ses03F_script02_2_F010 [097.7559-100.1798]: No
Ses03F_script02_2_F011 [100.2767-106.4819]: It's impossible. It's like waiting around. Waiting to see Santa Claus
Ses03F_script02_2_F012 [106.5325-114.0475]: Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up.
Ses03F_script02_2_M011 [113.2931-115.8875]: God
Ses03F_script02_2_F013 [115.3925-117.7773]: I do.
Ses03F_script02_2_F014 [118.1651-128.2485]: Look
Ses03F_script02_2_M012 [130.2604-135.9565]: It's just fish. Nothing to get traumatized over.
Ses03F_script02_2_F015 [134.4075-137.9684]: For God's sake
Ses03F_script02_2_M013 [136.0777-142.7919]: I've been turning this thing over in my head trying to figure out when the point was when we took a turn for the worse
Ses03F_script02_2_M014 [142.8647-157.6262]: You were fine during the phone call from Marge. Dinner was okay. Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see. I took a shower. You were watching the news. You said Augie
Ses03F_script02_2_M015 [157.6747-165.5039]: And so I'm getting the animals
Ses03F_script02_2_F016 [164.0738-169.2125]: Do you remember the last time we came here?
Ses03F_script02_2_F017 [169.2852-172.4847]: We thought I was pregnant.
Ses03F_script02_2_F018 [172.6059-176.3145]: You brought a bottle of champagne.
Ses03F_script02_2_F019 [176.4050-183.1256]: We took off our shoes and we danced barefoot in the sand. Under the moon.
Ses03F_script02_2_F020 [183.1975-189.5732]: And you whispered so intimately in my ear so I could feel your words.
Ses03F_script02_2_F021 [189.6702-195.9965]: Oh
Ses03F_script02_2_F022 [196.0935-202.0805]: I told myself finally
Ses03F_script02_2_M016 [202.2987-205.9830]: Wait a minute. I got it.
Ses03F_script02_2_F023 [205.0619-210.2750]: Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne.
Ses03F_script02_2_M017 [209.7300-219.4114]: It was driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker
Ses03F_script02_2_M018 [219.4841-224.5258]: You want this to be like the other time
Ses03F_script02_2_F024 [224.0411-227.1921]: I don't want to remember something.
Ses03F_script02_2_F025 [227.2925-229.9796]: Hope for some things.
Ses03F_script02_2_M019 [228.9373-235.7000]: Right. I got it. Of course. Listen
Ses03F_script02_2_F026 [234.9486-237.7436]: No.
Ses03F_script02_2_M020 [237.1350-239.7479]: Do you want me to get some champagne?
Ses03F_script02_2_F027 [239.2147-241.1296]: No.
Ses03F_script02_2_M021 [240.3539-242.8748]: Take off our shoes?
Ses03F_script02_2_F028 [242.4142-245.0563]: No
Ses03F_script02_2_M022 [242.9232-248.0619]: What? What? Do you want me to breathe in your ear?
Ses03F_script02_2_F029 [246.1470-248.5467]: No.
Ses03F_script02_2_M023 [248.5225-254.7034]: Do you want to get married again? What? What? Do you want to get a divorce?
Ses03F_script02_2_F030 [250.2700-252.1098]: No.
Ses03F_script02_2_F031 [253.0551-255.1639]: No.
Ses03F_script02_2_M024 [254.8004-256.9576]: A vacation?
Ses03F_script02_2_F032 [256.2305-258.1359]: No.
Ses03F_script02_2_M025 [257.2350-259.9390]: A new carpet? A poodle?
Ses03F_script02_2_M026 [259.9875-265.9745]: A-a back rub
Ses03F_script02_2_F033 [264.5325-268.6651]: I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.
Ses03F_script02_2_M027 [267.0895-270.1921]: Jesus
Ses03F_script02_2_M028 [270.2406-279.7665]: Did you think this is how I thought it was going to turn out? Do you think I had some great fantasy down the line? That four years down the line that we'd come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?
Ses03F_script02_2_M029 [279.8150-295.1125]: No
Ses03F_script02_2_M030 [295.1550-304.1752]: You know what you get? The jokes on us
Ses03F_script02_2_F034 [303.8601-307.7868]: This what? What is this? This is nothing.
Ses03F_script02_2_M031 [306.7445-309.1442]: Yes
Ses03F_script02_2_F035 [308.4170-312.7800]: No
Ses03F_script02_2_M032 [312.0529-313.7981]: Right.
Ses03F_script02_2_F036 [313.3860-318.2350]: Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be.
Ses03F_script02_2_M033 [317.4097-321.6515]: No
Ses03F_script02_2_F037 [320.9001-326.2812]: I mean
Ses03F_script02_2_F038 [326.4993-330.3533]: it's not something else. Do you know what I'm trying to say?
Ses03F_script02_2_M034 [329.5534-333.0438]: Well
Ses03F_script02_2_F039 [332.0258-344.2665]: I know you are
Ses03F_script02_2_M035 [344.1453-348.0963]: Yeah
Ses03F_script02_2_F040 [347.1509-349.3950]: I didn't say that.
Ses03F_script02_2_M036 [348.9689-352.8229]: No
Ses03F_script02_2_F041 [352.0775-357.4525]: Augie
Ses03F_script02_2_M037 [356.5799-359.1250]: Yeah?
Ses03F_script02_2_F042 [358.0343-367.7541]: God
Ses03F_script02_2_M038 [367.3178-372.5049]: Actually now that you mention it
Ses03F_script02_2_F043 [373.4745-381.5461]: Well
Ses03F_script02_2_M039 [381.4976-388.7208]: Seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean
Ses03F_script02_2_F044 [390.3933-394.2473]: I noticed that. It's beautiful.
Ses03F_script02_2_F045 [394.3443-398.0771]: You can see right over the water.
Ses03F_script02_2_F046 [398.2710-401.9000]: God
Ses03F_script02_2_M040 [403.2157-406.6577]: Look what we got here.
Ses03F_script02_2_F047 [406.2699-409.2028]: You brought refreshments?
Ses03F_script02_2_M041 [408.1363-411.8448]: It's not champagne.
Ses03F_script02_2_F048 [410.7783-414.4869]: At least we won't need glasses.
Ses03F_script02_2_M042 [416.3775-421.1041]: Are you still cold? Do you want to go home?
Ses03F_script02_2_F049 [421.3223-428.2304]: So I was thinking you might be right.
Ses03F_script02_2_F050 [428.5213-433.1994]: Maybe this is the right place after all.
Ses03F_script02_2_F051 [433.9993-437.0049]: I'm sorry
Ses03F_script02_2_M043 [435.2355-438.3381]: Shh.
Ses03F_script02_2_M044 [438.5320-441.5675]: If we're very quiet the fish might come.
Ses03F_script02_2_F052 [442.3860-445.0523]: Or not.
Ses03F_script02_2_M045 [445.2462-447.1014]: Or not.
Ses03F_script03_1_M000 [003.4000-005.2700]: Oh.
Ses03F_script03_1_F000 [004.8600-006.5200]: [BREATHING]
Ses03F_script03_1_M001 [006.0425-008.2650]: Good God.
Ses03F_script03_1_F001 [007.6700-009.9216]: Do you think it's them?
Ses03F_script03_1_M002 [009.2650-011.2025]: I wonder.
Ses03F_script03_1_F002 [010.7025-014.1700]: I mean
Ses03F_script03_1_M003 [013.7975-015.3150]: It must be them then.
Ses03F_script03_1_F003 [014.9625-016.9300]: What are we to do?
Ses03F_script03_1_M004 [017.0400-021.4200]: We're all right
Ses03F_script03_1_F004 [021.1650-024.4600]: Yes. Now and always
Ses03F_script03_1_M005 [024.4150-026.6375]: Then I don't care.
Ses03F_script03_1_F005 [026.1175-028.5475]: It was bound to come sooner or later.
Ses03F_script03_1_M006 [028.1900-034.2100]: Hello? Hello? What? Ugh
Ses03F_script03_1_F006 [034.0575-039.2300]: [LAUGHTER] God
Ses03F_script03_1_M007 [038.6900-043.4200]: things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy
Ses03F_script03_1_F007 [042.9100-050.0425]: Um terrible thing is one can't stay happy. Well
Ses03F_script03_1_M008 [044.5000-047.2100]: Ooh darling
Ses03F_script03_1_M009 [049.7225-052.8575]: You mean that sacred and beautiful thing
Ses03F_script03_1_F008 [052.4100-054.5900]: Yes
Ses03F_script03_1_M010 [053.8700-060.4900]: What does it all mean? That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth. What does it all mean?
Ses03F_script03_1_F009 [060.1800-063.8793]: Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.
Ses03F_script03_1_M011 [063.4200-066.3875]: [LAUGHTER]. You mustn't be serious
Ses03F_script03_1_F010 [065.9600-067.8700]: Who's they?
Ses03F_script03_1_M012 [068.3275-081.0700]: All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable. Laugh at them. Be flippant. Laugh at all the sacred shibboleths. Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.
Ses03F_script03_1_F011 [080.4800-084.1900]: Well
Ses03F_script03_1_M013 [083.1050-086.3300]: Ooh
Ses03F_script03_1_F012 [085.8800-090.0125]: So how long is it going to last? This ludicrous
Ses03F_script03_1_M014 [089.4700-091.2700]: Who knows?
Ses03F_script03_1_F013 [090.4500-093.6850]: Shall we always want to bicker and fight?
Ses03F_script03_1_M015 [093.1300-097.0375]: No. The fire will fade along with our passion.
Ses03F_script03_1_F014 [096.1525-098.9800]: Oh dear
Ses03F_script03_1_M016 [098.5300-101.0500]: Depends on how well we play it.
Ses03F_script03_1_F015 [100.2900-105.3900]: Well
Ses03F_script03_1_M017 [104.7700-108.5300]: Yes
Ses03F_script03_1_F016 [107.7300-110.1700]: Well
Ses03F_script03_1_M018 [109.7800-116.2475]: No. No
Ses03F_script03_1_F017 [115.6100-118.8000]: Darling
Ses03F_script03_1_M019 [118.3800-124.7727]: So is everyone else in the long run. Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.
Ses03F_script03_1_M020 [124.8432-143.1300]: Let's blow strumpets
Ses03F_script03_1_F018 [142.4475-145.8300]: Elliott
Ses03F_script03_1_M021 [145.0100-159.7050]: I don't care what you do
Ses03F_script03_1_F019 [159.3275-167.9300]: Thank you
Ses03F_script03_1_M022 [169.9100-174.3700]: Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
Ses03F_script03_1_F020 [173.2450-176.1500]: Which particular one?
Ses03F_script03_1_M023 [175.4025-180.9450]: The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it in my bed.
Ses03F_script03_1_F021 [180.0800-184.4400]: Oh Charles. That was his name. Charles. He did wiggle so beautifully.
Ses03F_script03_1_M024 [181.3450-185.6975]: Horrible little thing. I hated it.
Ses03F_script03_1_F022 [185.2025-191.3500]: I know you did. You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal. I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
Ses03F_script03_1_M025 [191.0600-193.2900]: How long did that row last?
Ses03F_script03_1_F023 [192.8000-196.0300]: It went on intermittently for days.
Ses03F_script03_1_M026 [195.5000-200.8500]: The worst one was in Cannes when your-your curling iron burnt a hole in my dressing gown.
Ses03F_script03_1_F024 [200.4400-204.8800]: Well
Ses03F_script03_1_F025 [207.0100-210.5900]: yeah. And that was the first time you ever hit me.
Ses03F_script03_1_M027 [204.5800-207.1400]: That was a rouser
Ses03F_script03_1_F026 [212.5100-218.3300]: The manager came in and found us rolling on the floor and biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]
Ses03F_script03_1_M028 [210.1500-212.8800]: I didn't hit you very hard.
Ses03F_script03_1_F027 [221.6700-226.2000]: I know. Oh man. Couldn't believe it.
Ses03F_script03_1_M029 [216.9700-221.7800]: Oh
Ses03F_script03_1_M030 [226.4800-228.6200]: We were very much younger then.
Ses03F_script03_1_F028 [228.0575-230.8200]: Yeah
Ses03F_script03_1_M031 [232.8800-238.2600]: Oh
Ses03F_script03_2_M000 [009.3056-014.3900]: As a matter of fact
Ses03F_script03_2_F000 [013.8388-016.6100]: You knew there was nothing in that.
Ses03F_script03_2_M001 [016.5000-020.4600]: I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.
Ses03F_script03_2_F001 [019.9700-023.8200]: Presents? It was only a small trivial little broach.
Ses03F_script03_2_M002 [023.2100-028.9000]: I remember it well. Bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste.
Ses03F_script03_2_F002 [028.2100-032.8600]: Not at all. It was very pretty. And I wear it all the time. I still have it.
Ses03F_script03_2_M003 [032.1900-035.7200]: You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses03F_script03_2_F003 [035.0700-040.5200]: No
Ses03F_script03_2_M004 [042.3800-045.5200]: You must admit that he was in love with you.
Ses03F_script03_2_F004 [045.3900-048.8425]: Just a little perhaps
Ses03F_script03_2_M005 [048.4250-051.1000]: You let him kiss you. You said so.
Ses03F_script03_2_F005 [050.5900-052.0650]: Well
Ses03F_script03_2_M006 [051.5900-053.3000]: What of it?
Ses03F_script03_2_F006 [052.6500-055.9025]: Oh come on
Ses03F_script03_2_M007 [055.4150-057.2475]: What about me?
Ses03F_script03_2_F007 [056.7050-061.0900]: Well
Ses03F_script03_2_M008 [060.6850-064.3750]: That's a nice point of view
Ses03F_script03_2_F008 [063.8825-066.3100]: Well
Ses03F_script03_2_M009 [073.0200-075.7200]: Are you bored with this conversation?
Ses03F_script03_2_F009 [075.4000-078.3725]: I definitely
Ses03F_script03_2_M010 [079.9900-085.2100]: So am I. Bored stiff. Want some brandy?
Ses03F_script03_2_F010 [084.7850-086.1650]: No
Ses03F_script03_2_M011 [086.1500-088.4400]: I'll have a little
Ses03F_script03_2_F011 [087.8625-091.2000]: I don't see why you want it; you've already had two glasses.
Ses03F_script03_2_M012 [090.7625-094.2950]: No particular reason. Anyhow
Ses03F_script03_2_F012 [093.7900-098.0400]: I don't see what's the point of going on and on about something like this.
Ses03F_script03_2_M013 [097.4400-104.3350]: Oh
Ses03F_script03_2_F013 [103.8975-106.0400]: It's become a habit with you.
Ses03F_script03_2_M014 [105.4700-110.3400]: You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment.
Ses03F_script03_2_F014 [109.5700-111.4700]: Don't be so stupid.
Ses03F_script03_2_M015 [110.9875-112.6200]: Really
Ses03F_script03_2_F015 [112.2400-113.6200]: What?
Ses03F_script03_2_M016 [113.9625-115.0850]: Nothing.
Ses03F_script03_2_M017 [118.2350-120.4650]: Going somewhere
Ses03F_script03_2_F016 [120.3100-124.6700]: No. Just making myself fascinating for you.
Ses03F_script03_2_M018 [124.3400-128.0300]: That reply has broken my heart.
Ses03F_script03_2_F017 [127.4075-132.9500]: It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me
Ses03F_script03_2_M019 [133.3900-136.3650]: As a matter of fact
Ses03F_script03_2_F018 [137.0025-138.4200]: No
Ses03F_script03_2_M020 [137.9200-139.3100]: Yes
Ses03F_script03_2_F019 [138.8625-142.2500]: No
Ses03F_script03_2_M021 [145.6300-150.9300]: It's a pity you didn't have more brandy. It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
Ses03F_script03_2_F020 [150.3100-153.9200]: Well
Ses03F_script03_2_M022 [153.1850-156.3475]: Oh
Ses03F_script03_2_F021 [155.9400-158.4625]: Adders don't snap
Ses03F_script03_2_M023 [157.8075-162.2025]: Yes
Ses03F_script03_2_F022 [161.8585-163.3200]: They sting.
Ses03F_script03_2_M024 [162.9400-164.1200]: They snap.
Ses03F_script03_2_F023 [163.6700-170.0200]: I don't care. I don't care
Ses03F_script03_2_M025 [170.7300-173.0700]: Uhh
Ses03F_script03_2_M026 [174.1875-178.8700]: did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
Ses03F_script03_2_F024 [177.9925-180.9500]: Yes
Ses03F_script03_2_M027 [180.6400-185.3875]: I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then
Ses03F_script03_2_F025 [184.9300-187.5075]: Mind your business.
Ses03F_script03_2_M028 [187.0375-194.7300]: You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.
Ses03F_script03_2_F026 [194.3200-198.1100]: You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk.
Ses03F_script03_2_M029 [197.3075-199.6900]: I'm not in the least bit drunk.
Ses03F_script03_2_F027 [198.9675-200.9700]: You've always had a weak head.
Ses03F_script03_2_M030 [200.5200-207.5800]: Okay. As I mentioned before
Ses03F_script03_2_F028 [207.1450-212.2362]: On the contrary
Ses03F_script03_2_M031 [211.2300-222.0875]: Oh
Ses03F_script03_2_F029 [214.6500-218.5425]: Do shut up. Shut up.
Ses03F_script03_2_F030 [221.9000-225.8411]: I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Ses03F_script03_2_M032 [232.4100-235.6300]: You better turn that off.
Ses03F_script03_2_F031 [235.9600-237.9500]: Why?
Ses03F_script03_2_M033 [238.0575-241.3500]: It's very late and it will annoy the people upstairs.
Ses03F_script03_2_F032 [240.8800-245.4600]: There aren't any people upstairs. It's a photographer's studio.
Ses03F_script03_2_M034 [244.7800-247.4375]: Well
Ses03F_script03_2_F033 [247.0350-248.9800]: They're away in Tunis.
Ses03F_script03_2_M035 [248.9800-251.3625]: This is no time of the year for Tunis.
Ses03F_script03_2_F034 [250.8575-253.3100]: Turn it on again
Ses03F_script03_2_M036 [252.0725-254.0900]: No
Ses03F_script03_2_F035 [254.4000-256.8000]: Turn it on.
Ses03F_script03_2_M037 [260.0300-261.8750]: No.
Ses03F_script03_2_F036 [261.4650-268.5400]: You've always had far too temperamental for yourself. You should try to control it.
Ses03F_script03_2_M038 [271.2375-272.7375]: Turn it off.
Ses03F_script03_2_F037 [272.9175-276.5650]: I will not. Go away. Go away. I hate you.
Ses03F_script03_2_M039 [276.0875-279.9900]: Oh
Ses03F_script03_2_F038 [278.8800-285.5100]: Listen
Ses03F_script03_2_M040 [284.8575-287.3500]: Very amusing indeed.

Ses03M_impro04_F028 [248.8300-256.3000]: Well obviously it's not working.  Just cause you got sixteen hundred on your S.A.T. doesn't guarantee you a job.  I mean it should really but--
Ses03M_impro04_M035 [255.7700-262.5700]: I don't know.  I don't know.  I know I'm just going to have to keep on looking

Ses03M_impro06_F008 [096.6931-098.8348]: Oh man.

Ses03M_impro06_M019 [143.6889-152.0367]: then I got busy with work and stuff and three years go by
Ses03M_impro06_M020 [152.3044-156.2958]: and then something like this happens you know?
Ses03M_impro06_M021 [156.4905-161.4797]: I mean I haven't even talked to him on the phone for the past three months.
Ses03M_impro06_M022 [161.7717-164.8139]: He's supposed to be my best friend.
Ses03M_impro06_F012 [164.0351-166.3472]: I know.
Ses03M_impro06_F013 [167.9048-175.1087]: just things happen in life and you just...there's just no explanation you know?  We just don't...
Ses03M_impro06_M023 [175.1087-178.2726]: It's so fucked up.
Ses03M_impro06_F014 [177.1044-179.2704]: Yeah.
Ses03M_impro06_F015 [180.8037-182.9697]: I'm so sorry.
Ses03M_impro06_M024 [182.0206-184.6003]: Why is that?
Ses03M_impro06_M025 [185.4522-189.8573]: He was studying to be a doctor.
Ses03M_impro06_M026 [190.0520-199.5193]: I mean he was...he wanted to help people in poor countries
Ses03M_impro06_M027 [199.6100-204.8248]: What the...what am I doing?
Ses03M_impro06_M028 [204.8979-208.8892]: Working for corporate America?  Wow.

Ses03M_impro06_F016 [212.9536-219.8655]: Well now you can follow his footsteps
Ses03M_impro06_M030 [219.2327-221.3744]: I can't do that.
Ses03M_impro06_F017 [220.2792-223.6378]: Well sure you could.

Ses03M_impro08a_F007 [061.8767-069.4487]: I don't
Ses03M_impro08a_M006 [068.6402-077.5530]: Um- I think part of it has to do with the network being down.  It's been having some trouble the last few weeks--

Ses03M_impro08a_F015 [121.3084-126.2775]: I would like to talk to your supervisor.  Obviously you're incompetent and don't understand what I'm asking.

Ses03M_script01_1_F000 [006.6092-011.7770]: What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.
Ses03M_script01_1_M000 [011.4606-014.6773]: He saw it.
Ses03M_script01_1_F001 [014.5015-019.6517]: What do you mean. He couldn't have seen it. I was the first one up
Ses03M_script01_1_M001 [019.2650-021.9192]: He was out there when it happened.
Ses03M_script01_1_F002 [021.3040-023.5188]: When?
Ses03M_script01_1_M002 [023.1025-032.3525]: About four in the morning.  I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened.
F: What was he doing--?
Ses03M_script01_1_F003 [031.8506-034.5927]: Well what was he doing out at four in the morning?
Ses03M_script01_1_M003 [034.2060-040.1648]: I don't know. But after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen.
Ses03M_script01_1_F004 [040.0593-042.3795]: Did you talk to him?
Ses03M_script01_1_M004 [041.7292-047.2837]: No.  I figured the best thing to do was leave him alone.
Ses03M_script01_1_F005 [047.5298-049.4985]: He cried hard?
Ses03M_script01_1_M005 [049.0414-051.4320]: I could hear it right through the floor.
Ses03M_script01_1_F006 [051.5374-054.8596]: God
Ses03M_script01_1_F007 [054.9651-059.2013]: Starting to dream about him again.  He's walking around at night again.
Ses03M_script01_1_M006 [058.7443-061.4160]: I guess he is.
Ses03M_script01_1_F008 [061.0118-066.7850]: He's getting just like he did after he died
Ses03M_script01_1_M007 [066.2323-072.5602]: I don't know.  But I know one thing mom
Ses03M_script01_1_F009 [071.9274-073.9489]: What?
Ses03M_script01_1_M008 [073.2985-078.5718]: Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.
Ses03M_script01_1_F010 [077.8159-079.6950]: What do you mean dishonest?
Ses03M_script01_1_M009 [079.1870-087.9758]: You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.
Ses03M_script01_1_F011 [087.5187-090.4366]: What are you going to do?  You want to argue with him?
Ses03M_script01_1_M010 [090.0851-096.7118]: No I don't want to argue with him but
Ses03M_script01_1_M011 [096.7470-110.3169]: Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night.  Walk around.  Why shouldn't he walk around?  Why shouldn't he dream of him
Ses03M_script01_1_M012 [110.3520-113.4632]: That we haven't had any hope for years now?
Ses03M_script01_1_F012 [113.1996-116.0999]: You can't say that to him.
Ses03M_script01_1_M013 [115.5726-117.6116]: We got to say it to him.
Ses03M_script01_1_F013 [117.0666-119.8625]: How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?
Ses03M_script01_1_M014 [119.4396-125.1699]: Larry's been gone for three years.  For god sakes no one comes back after three years.  It's insane.
Ses03M_script01_1_F014 [124.5723-128.6327]: To you maybe
Ses03M_script01_1_F015 [128.6854-136.6656]: he still thinks he's alive still.  I mean you could talk yourself blue in the face and there's no body and there's no grave so where are you?
Ses03M_script01_1_M015 [136.0504-140.6733]: Listen mom
Ses03M_script01_1_F016 [140.0581-148.8821]: No.  It's his god damned newspapers is what it is.  Now every month there's a new boy comes home and Larry's going to be the next one.
Ses03M_script01_1_M016 [145.6450-149.2160]: Alright. Alright. Alright just listen.
Ses03M_script01_1_M017 [149.6027-153.3625]: You know why I asked Annie here
Ses03M_script01_1_F017 [152.8722-155.0166]: Why?
Ses03M_script01_1_M018 [154.1553-156.1943]: You know.
Ses03M_script01_1_F018 [155.5967-160.2372]: Well I have an idea but I don't know.  What's the story?
Ses03M_script01_1_M019 [159.4110-162.7156]: I want to ask her to marry me.
Ses03M_script01_1_F019 [162.5223-165.5104]: Well that's your business Chris.
Ses03M_script01_1_M020 [165.0359-167.9010]: You know it's not just my business.
Ses03M_script01_1_F020 [167.0748-171.3638]: Well what do you want me to do?  I mean
Ses03M_script01_1_M021 [170.3619-173.6137]: Okay.  So then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.
Ses03M_script01_1_F021 [173.0336-177.7620]: Well
Ses03M_script01_1_M022 [176.5843-188.5546]: Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes.  Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit?  Huh?  God you have such a talent for ignoring things.
Ses03M_script01_1_F022 [178.2718-180.4162]: Well I'm just saying--
Ses03M_script01_1_F023 [188.3964-191.9471]: You know I ignore what I got to ignore.
Ses03M_script01_1_F024 [192.1053-195.7439]: She's not...she's Larry's girl.
Ses03M_script01_1_M023 [195.0056-197.2731]: She's not Larry's girl.
Ses03M_script01_1_F025 [196.9040-205.9916]: From your father's point of view he is still alive and if you try and take her that's just not fair.  You can't do that.
Ses03M_script01_1_M024 [217.5225-222.9188]: I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want I have to pull back
Ses03M_script01_1_F026 [206.0268-217.2625]: And-And-And if you go on from there if you know already to go on from there
Ses03M_script01_1_M025 [222.9540-224.9875]: Because other people will suffer.
Ses03M_script01_1_M026 [225.1700-230.1959]: My whole entire
Ses03M_script01_1_F027 [230.0377-235.1352]: You're a considerate fellow.  There is nothing wrong in that.
Ses03M_script01_1_M027 [234.7134-236.7524]: Well to hell with that.
Ses03M_script01_1_F028 [236.4360-239.4417]: Did you ask Annie yet?
Ses03M_script01_1_M028 [239.2308-242.2893]: I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses03M_script01_1_F029 [241.4456-246.5175]: And what if she doesn't marry you huh?  What if she feels the same way your father does?
Ses03M_script01_1_M029 [245.8575-248.1426]: Then I guess that's the end of it.
Ses03M_script01_1_M030 [248.2129-253.0675]: But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.
Ses03M_script01_1_M031 [253.1150-259.0759]: And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom
Ses03M_script01_1_F030 [259.0583-264.3950]: Look
Ses03M_script01_1_M032 [263.8218-267.2846]: Well so what?  I'm just not fast with women.
Ses03M_script01_1_F031 [266.5639-270.4837]: Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses03M_script01_1_M033 [270.3431-273.2258]: Because it is.
Ses03M_script01_1_F032 [273.8586-282.9111]: Well that's a good answer but
Ses03M_script01_1_M034 [282.8408-295.1075]: It's just...that's just the way it is.  That's how I feel.  You know these years when I think of someone I want to marry I think of Annie.  What do you want a diagram?
Ses03M_script01_1_F033 [294.6353-297.7290]: No I don't want a diagram.
Ses03M_script01_1_F034 [298.7660-310.8594]: He thinks he's coming back. And you go off and marry that girl and you're just pronouncing him dead and what's going to happen to him?  I don't know.  Do you?  I mean
M:  No.
Ses03M_script01_1_M035 [312.0547-315.7108]: Alright then.
Ses03M_script01_1_F035 [315.3593-319.1736]: Look
Ses03M_script01_1_M036 [318.8396-329.8432]: I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.
Ses03M_script01_1_M037 [329.9225-333.3939]: But if I can't have that here I'll get out.
Ses03M_script01_1_F036 [333.5675-336.3425]: What the hell is this?
Ses03M_script01_1_M038 [335.6965-341.2450]: I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York.
Ses03M_script01_1_F037 [340.8468-343.4482]: Are you crazy?
Ses03M_script01_1_M039 [343.7998-349.6275]: I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it.
Ses03M_script01_1_F038 [349.2840-354.1175]: You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that.
Ses03M_script01_1_M040 [352.1675-356.1600]: The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses03M_script01_1_F039 [355.6998-358.2486]: Oh
Ses03M_script01_1_M041 [357.4927-371.9591]: Yes.  I like it an hour out of the day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family.  I want a wife.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.
Ses03M_script01_1_M042 [372.0118-376.0898]: Now Annie is in the middle of all that.  Where do I find it?
Ses03M_script01_1_F040 [376.5100-381.0642]: Tell me something.  You can leave this business?
Ses03M_script01_1_M043 [380.5369-384.1403]: Yes.  On this I would.
Ses03M_script01_1_F041 [383.9997-386.9000]: You can't talk like that.
Ses03M_script01_1_M044 [386.7945-389.8003]: Then help me stay here.
Ses03M_script01_1_F042 [390.2222-394.1947]: Alright but you can't talk like that you hear?
Ses03M_script01_1_F043 [394.2475-401.1175]: I mean what the hell have we worked for then?  I mean
Ses03M_script01_1_M045 [399.5734-403.1625]: I know.  Just you help me stay here.
Ses03M_script01_1_F044 [403.0011-407.7118]: Alright but you don't talk like that you hear?  You don't.
Ses03M_script01_1_M046 [407.0791-410.5946]: I am thinking like that.
Ses03M_script01_1_F045 [411.4559-414.7429]: I don't understand you do I?
Ses03M_script01_1_M047 [414.2156-418.5924]: No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses03M_script01_1_F046 [419.0670-422.6352]: Yeah.  I can see that.
Ses03M_script01_2_F000 [007.4531-009.9374]: Why did he invite her here?
Ses03M_script01_2_M000 [009.3923-011.7309]: Why does that bother you?
Ses03M_script01_2_F001 [011.3988-016.8059]: Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up.
Ses03M_script01_2_M001 [015.7165-018.7325]: Well maybe
Ses03M_script01_2_F002 [018.3847-021.5754]: Nobody travels seven hundred miles just see.
Ses03M_script01_2_M002 [021.0705-027.2950]: uh-uh What do you mean?  They grew up next to each other their entire lives.  Why shouldn't he want to see her?
Ses03M_script01_2_M003 [027.3550-031.1674]: Hey don't look at me like that.  I don't know anymore than you.
Ses03M_script01_2_F003 [031.0611-033.5056]: He's not going to marry her.
Ses03M_script01_2_M004 [033.7315-037.4646]: Who said he even thought about that?
Ses03M_script01_2_F004 [037.1458-040.8700]: I see it.  It has the appearance of it.
Ses03M_script01_2_M005 [040.3741-042.2050]: Well
Ses03M_script01_2_F005 [043.3633-045.7050]: What's going on here Joe?
Ses03M_script01_2_M006 [045.1967-048.1195]: Now listen kid...
Ses03M_script01_2_F006 [046.7644-051.0024]: No.  She's not his girl Joe and she knows that.
Ses03M_script01_2_M007 [053.1546-056.1305]: You can't read her mind.
Ses03M_script01_2_F007 [055.7187-068.1725]: Then why is still single?  I mean there's plenty of single men in New York.  Why isn't she married by now?  Probably a hundred men has told her that she's foolish but
Ses03M_script01_2_M008 [067.5692-070.9304]: How do you know why she's waited?  Hmmm?
Ses03M_script01_2_F008 [070.3990-073.7469]: Because she knows what I know
Ses03M_script01_2_F009 [073.7734-078.7023]: I mean
Ses03M_script01_2_F010 [079.4197-084.5877]: My worst times I think about her
Ses03M_script01_2_F011 [085.2775-091.8282]: it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again.
Ses03M_script01_2_M009 [093.1567-098.3513]: Look at how nice the day is.  What are we arguing for?
Ses03M_script01_2_F012 [097.5675-106.5882]: No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father
Ses03M_script01_2_M010 [105.7114-108.4482]: What do you want me to do?  What do you want?
Ses03M_script01_2_F013 [106.9775-114.1875]: I want-I want you to act like he's still alive.  I mean don't think I haven't seen the way that you've been since he invited her here.
Ses03M_script01_2_M011 [113.6693-115.5957]: But Kate...
Ses03M_script01_2_F014 [115.1174-123.1816]: But I won't have any of this nonsense because you know what happens?  If he doesn't come back I'll kill myself.
Ses03M_script01_2_F015 [123.2250-137.2508]: Laugh
Ses03M_script01_2_M012 [131.1125-136.2145]: Okay. Calm yourself. Just calm yourself.
Ses03M_script01_2_F016 [137.9875-140.7125]: I can't do it all alone.
Ses03M_script01_2_M013 [141.5286-144.7525]: Calm yourself
Ses03M_script01_2_F017 [144.3850-154.9601]: Look
Ses03M_script01_2_M014 [149.5275-157.9626]: Alright
Ses03M_script01_2_F018 [158.1087-161.2573]: Look
Ses03M_script01_2_M015 [160.9784-164.5521]: Wait
Ses03M_script01_2_M016 [164.6318-166.8450]: Look at you
Ses03M_script01_2_F019 [166.3855-168.0925]: I can't help it.
Ses03M_script01_2_M017 [167.4882-173.4799]: What do I got to hide?  Huh?  What the hell's the matter with you Kate?
Ses03M_script01_3_F000 [006.1934-011.6235]: You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.
Ses03M_script01_3_M000 [010.4249-015.5925]: I know.  It sort of went out of style didn't it?
Ses03M_script01_3_F001 [015.0037-019.1253]: No.  It's alright.  It's a good thing
Ses03M_script01_3_F002 [020.4556-023.3560]: It's lovely here.
Ses03M_script01_3_F003 [025.1150-028.1319]: The air is so sweet.
Ses03M_script01_3_M001 [028.7207-032.0573]: You're not sorry you came?
Ses03M_script01_3_F004 [031.7301-037.9017]: No.  I'm not sorry.  But I'm not going to stay.
Ses03M_script01_3_M002 [037.1821-039.4064]: Why?
Ses03M_script01_3_F005 [038.8394-042.3941]: First of all your mother so much as told me to go.
Ses03M_script01_3_M003 [041.6308-044.1605]: Well...
Ses03M_script01_3_F006 [043.9424-046.9083]: Look
Ses03M_script01_3_F007 [047.6497-055.3250]: you saw the way that she acted and then well
Ses03M_script01_3_M004 [054.7372-057.0052]: What?
Ses03M_script01_3_F008 [056.6300-062.8279]: Well
Ses03M_script01_3_M005 [061.9338-071.3765]: Well the trouble is I was planning on sneaking up on you over a week or so and they take it for granted that we're all set.
Ses03M_script01_3_F009 [070.5478-074.4175]: Yeah.  I know they would
Ses03M_script01_3_M006 [073.8626-076.0651]: How did you know?
Ses03M_script01_3_F010 [075.2800-080.2086]: Well what other reason
Ses03M_script01_3_M007 [079.9687-084.3520]: So
Ses03M_script01_3_M008 [084.4175-090.2475]: I mean
Ses03M_script01_3_F011 [091.3959-093.4022]: Well
Ses03M_script01_3_M009 [096.8260-104.3060]: Oh Annie.  I love you.  I love you a great deal.
Ses03M_script01_3_M010 [105.7454-108.1442]: I love you.
Ses03M_script01_3_F012 [093.5331-096.4335]: I guess that's why I came.
Ses03M_script01_3_M011 [108.2968-113.7924]: I don't...I have no imagination that's the only way I know how to tell it.
Ses03M_script01_3_M012 [113.8578-124.0950]: I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell you this here.  I wanted to drive someplace brand new where we'd be brand new to each other.  It feels wrong here don't you?
Ses03M_script01_3_M013 [124.1675-130.2572]: This yard and this chair.  I don't want to win you from anything
Ses03M_script01_3_F013 [129.4285-133.1025]: Look
Ses03M_script01_3_M014 [132.4379-135.7091]: Then he's gone forever
Ses03M_script01_3_F014 [135.2293-138.7622]: Look
Ses03M_script01_3_M015 [138.0643-140.4850]: Why didn't you?
Ses03M_script01_3_F015 [140.6812-143.5600]: You started to write me.
Ses03M_script01_3_M016 [143.6775-146.3948]: You felt something that far back.
Ses03M_script01_3_F016 [145.5879-147.9868]: Every day since.
Ses03M_script01_3_M017 [148.0740-151.2361]: Why didn't you let me know?
Ses03M_script01_3_F017 [151.3888-158.5199]: I was waiting for you Chris
Ses03M_script01_3_F018 [158.6725-162.3362]: You'd always be so ambiguous.
Ses03M_script01_3_M018 [162.7288-168.8567]: Give me a kiss Ann
Ses03M_script01_3_M019 [170.1900-177.5798]: Oh God.  Annie
Ses03M_script01_3_F019 [181.1126-183.4461]: I'll never forgive you for that.
Ses03M_script01_3_M020 [177.9425-181.6575]: How long
Ses03M_script01_3_F020 [183.4897-190.0102]: I mean
Ses03M_script01_3_M021 [190.9697-197.0104]: We're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.
Ses03M_script01_3_F021 [196.8578-200.8268]: Not like that you're not.
Ses03M_script01_3_M022 [200.5869-202.9750]: I kissed you.
Ses03M_script01_3_F022 [202.4623-207.2382]: Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you Chris.
Ses03M_script01_3_M023 [210.0732-216.9700]: Nothing.  Hey
Ses03M_script01_3_F023 [208.7647-210.8801]: What is it?
Ses03M_script01_3_F024 [216.4192-219.2324]: No
Ses03M_script01_3_M024 [218.6872-221.4132]: No
Ses03M_script01_3_F025 [220.7590-226.9087]: Tell me what's wrong.  I mean
Ses03M_script01_3_M025 [226.0582-234.0180]: Well
Ses03M_script01_3_F026 [233.2111-235.9371]: You got to tell me.
Ses03M_script01_3_M026 [235.7844-238.9684]: I don't know where to start.
Ses03M_script01_3_F027 [238.3796-241.9124]: Okay.  It wouldn't work like this?
Ses03M_script01_3_M027 [243.9405-249.4578]: You remember overseas I was in command of a company?
Ses03M_script01_3_F028 [248.1930-250.3738]: Yeah
Ses03M_script01_3_M028 [250.1557-252.8162]: Well I lost them.
Ses03M_script01_3_F029 [252.7072-254.9098]: How many?
Ses03M_script01_3_M029 [254.1683-256.6762]: Just about all.
Ses03M_script01_3_F030 [256.2836-258.5953]: Geez.
Ses03M_script01_3_M030 [258.2862-263.8721]: Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men.
Ses03M_script01_3_M031 [264.0975-276.0196]: For instance
Ses03M_script01_3_M032 [276.0850-286.1925]: That's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys I had.  They didn't just die
Ses03M_script01_3_M033 [286.2625-297.9175]: A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created.
Ses03M_script01_3_M034 [297.9900-305.7700]: It was a kind of responsibility
Ses03M_script01_3_M035 [305.8650-316.6907]: And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him.
Ses03M_script01_3_M036 [316.8217-329.4952]: And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.
Ses03M_script01_3_M037 [329.6400-341.5275]: And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said
Ses03M_script01_3_M038 [341.6350-351.2996]: It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive.  I felt wrong to have that new checkbook
Ses03M_script01_3_M039 [351.3650-357.7111]: open that new bank account
Ses03M_script01_3_M040 [357.8637-370.2505]: cause you can take those things out of the war.  But you got to know
Ses03M_script01_3_M041 [370.3325-375.1136]: Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.
Ses03M_script01_3_M042 [375.2492-382.1793]: And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.
Ses03M_script01_3_F031 [382.4192-385.8212]: And you still feel that way?
Ses03M_script01_3_M043 [385.2760-388.0673]: I want you now Annie.
Ses03M_script01_3_F032 [387.7184-394.5100]: Cause you must not feel that way again.  You hear me?  You can't.  You deserve everything you have Chris.
Ses03M_script01_3_F033 [394.6050-407.4260]: that includes me too
Ses03M_script01_3_M044 [404.0087-405.4917]: [GARBAGE] Annie
Ses03M_script01_3_M045 [407.0182-410.6601]: Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.
Ses03M_script01_3_F034 [411.0308-414.9780]: What am I going to do with a fortune?
Ses03M_script01_3_M046 [415.3051-417.3100]: Buy some hats?
Ses03M_script02_1_M000 [008.0641-017.6619]: Hey
Ses03M_script02_1_M001 [017.8103-022.9225]: Look at the night we got.  I wouldn't trade this for anything.
Ses03M_script02_1_M002 [023.3513-033.6747]: You know actually I wanted to go a little further up the coast and get away from all the lights and people but I was afraid you'd miss it.  How are you doing?
Ses03M_script02_1_F000 [033.0150-035.3238]: Fine.
Ses03M_script02_1_M003 [034.8950-042.6458]: Is that
Ses03M_script02_1_M004 [042.6800-048.7125]: But if I can't tell
Ses03M_script02_1_M005 [048.7575-056.0500]: Oh
Ses03M_script02_1_F001 [055.6737-057.3558]: What flashlight?
Ses03M_script02_1_M006 [056.8281-060.9975]: You know
Ses03M_script02_1_F002 [060.5550-063.1200]: It's not your flashlight.
Ses03M_script02_1_M007 [062.3691-064.9087]: Well
Ses03M_script02_1_F003 [064.3645-066.6875]: It's ours.  Mine too.
Ses03M_script02_1_M008 [066.2444-067.9760]: Well
Ses03M_script02_1_F004 [067.6132-073.3356]: Well
Ses03M_script02_1_M009 [072.9893-081.0725]: No.  Of course
Ses03M_script02_1_M010 [081.0950-087.4189]: How could we have not thought to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.
Ses03M_script02_1_M011 [087.4849-093.8225]: Was it a full moon last year when they were running?  I can't remember.  Do you remember?
Ses03M_script02_1_F005 [093.2403-095.2027]: Yes.
Ses03M_script02_1_M012 [094.9553-098.7812]: Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?
Ses03M_script02_1_M013 [099.0616-105.0478]: We should've brought the blanket
Ses03M_script02_1_M014 [105.1303-113.0130]: God.  Oh
Ses03M_script02_1_M015 [113.1449-125.1669]: I'm so stupid
Ses03M_script02_1_M016 [125.2328-131.0047]: I wonder if they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?
Ses03M_script02_1_F006 [131.5159-134.5338]: Look
Ses03M_script02_1_M017 [134.2864-137.1559]: Do you want my jacket?
Ses03M_script02_1_F007 [136.6446-139.9150]: It's past eleven
Ses03M_script02_1_M018 [139.4316-147.5122]: What?  Are you kidding me?  We just got here.  We miss it.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?
Ses03M_script02_1_F008 [147.1494-149.4650]: There is no point in coming down here.
Ses03M_script02_1_M019 [149.1448-150.6455]: Right.
Ses03M_script02_1_F009 [149.8869-152.0308]: That's my point.
Ses03M_script02_1_M020 [151.2887-159.4875]: That's my point too...No.  No.  That's not my point.  My point is what's the point if we come down here if we just turn around and leave?
Ses03M_script02_1_F010 [152.7025-154.1375]: So let's go.
Ses03M_script02_1_M021 [159.5450-161.3675]: I mean
Ses03M_script02_1_F011 [161.3075-163.2650]: Not particularly.
Ses03M_script02_1_M022 [162.8159-164.5969]: Why not?
Ses03M_script02_1_F012 [164.0197-167.1036]: I don't know.  I just don't.
Ses03M_script02_1_M023 [166.4109-180.6592]: Honey
Ses03M_script02_1_F013 [180.1315-188.0500]: Pass up what?  These fish swim up to shore
Ses03M_script02_1_M024 [187.1896-199.3435]: Well this is like the highlight
Ses03M_script02_1_M025 [199.3930-205.6761]: But this is the big night for these guys.  Their last
Ses03M_script02_1_F014 [205.0824-213.5093]: What are you getting so excited about?  I mean
Ses03M_script02_1_M026 [212.7177-214.9575]: Yeah they do.
Ses03M_script02_1_F015 [214.3998-216.6756]: Augie.
Ses03M_script02_1_M027 [216.3952-231.0393]: Okay.  But it's fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows in Capistrano or the Lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs
Ses03M_script02_1_M028 [231.0887-234.2715]: I mean
Ses03M_script02_1_F016 [233.7108-235.9866]: I'm just not.
Ses03M_script02_1_M029 [235.3599-236.7225]: For real?
Ses03M_script02_1_F017 [236.4483-238.0480]: Yes.
Ses03M_script02_1_M030 [237.5038-243.2700]: I don't get it.  I mean the first time we came to see it
Ses03M_script02_1_M031 [243.3125-250.1194]: And last year when we came you ran out of the house so fast you stubbed your toe and you didn't even notice it until we got in the car.
Ses03M_script02_1_F018 [250.1029-259.7750]: You also could remember that I got sand in my panties
Ses03M_script02_1_M032 [259.1400-262.2050]: Okay.  We're in a good spot.
Ses03M_script02_1_F019 [261.6796-264.4501]: You didn't see them the first time either.
Ses03M_script02_1_M033 [263.6090-271.7061]: We just weren't in the good spot.  This is a much better spot.  You know
Ses03M_script02_1_M034 [271.7625-274.9200]: Look
Ses03M_script02_1_M035 [274.9879-280.5948]: You know
Ses03M_script02_1_M036 [280.6575-286.5775]: I mean
Ses03M_script02_1_M037 [286.6150-299.1050]: Somewhere out there
Ses03M_script02_1_M038 [299.1650-317.5925]: ...like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming this way.  They didn't
Ses03M_script02_1_M039 [317.6500-328.8550]: It's single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge and they don't
Ses03M_script02_1_M040 [328.9100-335.6750]: They just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.
Ses03M_script02_1_M041 [335.7475-341.1200]: Oh
Ses03M_script02_1_F020 [340.6551-342.8649]: That's the wind.
Ses03M_script02_1_M042 [342.2218-345.5300]: [BREATHING] So what do you think?
Ses03M_script02_1_F021 [345.1901-347.2021]: About what?
Ses03M_script02_1_M043 [346.5589-349.3624]: About what I just said?
Ses03M_script02_1_F022 [348.7522-351.3743]: It's ridiculous.
Ses03M_script02_1_M044 [351.0115-353.0475]: It certainly is not.  It's
Ses03M_script02_2_M000 [005.2815-008.0225]: So what do you think?
Ses03M_script02_2_F000 [007.2672-009.5454]: About what?
Ses03M_script02_2_M001 [008.9530-011.5957]: About what I just said?
Ses03M_script02_2_F001 [011.6640-013.8350]: It's ridiculous.
Ses03M_script02_2_M002 [013.1220-018.3650]: It certainly is not.  It's a slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
Ses03M_script02_2_F002 [017.8150-025.0366]: It's PR.  I mean
Ses03M_script02_2_M003 [024.2165-027.6565]: I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.
Ses03M_script02_2_F003 [025.9251-037.4296]: Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean
Ses03M_script02_2_M004 [037.7030-041.1886]: Are we talking about the same thing?
Ses03M_script02_2_F004 [040.4140-043.7175]: Look
Ses03M_script02_2_M005 [043.0111-045.6081]: I thought you wanted to see it.
Ses03M_script02_2_F005 [045.3348-047.7040]: It's just...
Ses03M_script02_2_F006 [048.7292-055.4975]: Look
Ses03M_script02_2_M006 [054.6979-067.1820]: There's nothing to it.  The Grunions arrive
Ses03M_script02_2_F007 [066.2252-070.1525]: For heavens sake
Ses03M_script02_2_M007 [069.5057-071.3282]: Why not?
Ses03M_script02_2_F008 [070.3550-073.0125]: We never do
Ses03M_script02_2_M008 [072.3534-075.8845]: Oh my gosh.  We missed them twice
Ses03M_script02_2_F009 [075.2921-079.7801]: Okay.  Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever.
Ses03M_script02_2_M009 [079.9851-083.3225]: Carla
Ses03M_script02_2_F010 [082.7872-084.0857]: What?
Ses03M_script02_2_M010 [083.5617-087.2975]: Don't take this wrong but
Ses03M_script02_2_F011 [086.6600-092.9249]: Augie
Ses03M_script02_2_M011 [092.0819-095.0891]: What's bugging you then?
Ses03M_script02_2_F012 [094.7246-104.8167]: Look
Ses03M_script02_2_F013 [104.8650-113.5647]: Listen
Ses03M_script02_2_M012 [112.3345-114.9544]: I thought you wanted to see it.
Ses03M_script02_2_F014 [114.1798-116.8908]: God
Ses03M_script02_2_M013 [115.9112-118.2804]: No
Ses03M_script02_2_F015 [117.5742-124.8187]: I do.  I always do.  I keep thinking
Ses03M_script02_2_M014 [125.4337-131.2202]: Well
Ses03M_script02_2_F016 [130.2406-135.8676]: No we won't.  I mean
Ses03M_script02_2_M015 [134.5690-144.5472]: What...I've been trying to
Ses03M_script02_2_M016 [144.6375-151.0075]: You were fine during the phone call with Marge
Ses03M_script02_2_M017 [151.0875-161.6104]: Let's see I took a shower
Ses03M_script02_2_M018 [161.6788-168.2170]: And then I'm putting the animals out in the yard
Ses03M_script02_2_F017 [168.8321-173.7529]: Look
Ses03M_script02_2_F018 [173.8212-177.5573]: We thought I was pregnant.
Ses03M_script02_2_F019 [177.6485-183.5488]: We brought a bottle of champagne and we took off our shoes and danced barefoot in the sand...
Ses03M_script02_2_F020 [183.6399-191.6817]: Under the moon and you whispered so softly into my ear so I could feel your words.
Ses03M_script02_2_F021 [192.0007-202.4573]: And I thought
Ses03M_script02_2_M019 [202.4117-207.1274]: Wait a minute.  I've got it.
Ses03M_script02_2_F022 [208.6993-216.0121]: What?  Dancing barefoot in the sand?  Drinking out of a bottle of champagne?
Ses03M_script02_2_M020 [215.3059-221.4113]: It was in the car right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker...
Ses03M_script02_2_M021 [221.4875-230.3075]: And you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that.
Ses03M_script02_2_M022 [230.4775-232.5100]: You want this to be like the other time right?  That's it right?
Ses03M_script02_2_F023 [232.3919-235.9685]: I'd rather not remember something...
Ses03M_script02_2_F024 [236.2191-239.8641]: Rather not hope for something.
Ses03M_script02_2_M023 [239.2946-245.3772]: Okay
Ses03M_script02_2_F025 [244.6938-246.7669]: No.
Ses03M_script02_2_M024 [246.4024-250.7125]: Do you want me to get some champagne?
Ses03M_script02_2_F026 [249.9335-252.1660]: No.
Ses03M_script02_2_M025 [251.3687-253.9658]: Take off our shoes?
Ses03M_script02_2_F027 [253.1456-254.8314]: No.
Ses03M_script02_2_M026 [254.0569-258.3529]: What?  Do you want me to breathe in your ear?
Ses03M_script02_2_F028 [257.7474-260.5550]: No.
Ses03M_script02_2_M027 [260.9368-276.8950]: Do you want to get married again? What? What?  Do you want a divorce? A vacation? What?  A carpet?  A poodle?  A basket of fruit?  What?  A suicide pact?  What the hell do you want Carla?
Ses03M_script02_2_F029 [262.3575-266.6321]: No...No...No...
Ses03M_script02_2_F030 [266.6777-268.8419]: No...
Ses03M_script02_2_F031 [276.1319-280.5515]: I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.
Ses03M_script02_2_M028 [279.8909-283.0347]: Welcome to the human race.
Ses03M_script02_2_M029 [283.1030-293.0584]: Do you think that this is what I had in mind?  That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?  No.
Ses03M_script02_2_M030 [293.1040-307.9800]: I was just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids...
Ses03M_script02_2_M031 [308.1000-316.9332]: ...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this.
Ses03M_script02_2_F032 [316.2726-325.2940]: This what...what's this?  This isn't anything. Alright.  Sure.  Standing on the beach
Ses03M_script02_2_M032 [318.9835-321.2844]: Yes it is.
Ses03M_script02_2_M033 [324.8155-326.7292]: Right.
Ses03M_script02_2_F033 [326.5241-332.2422]: Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be.
Ses03M_script02_2_M034 [331.3310-334.4520]: No.  I know.  Me neither.
Ses03M_script02_2_F034 [334.2698-345.6376]: This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?
Ses03M_script02_2_M035 [344.6125-347.4575]: I'm trying to do the best I can.
Ses03M_script02_2_F035 [346.7539-352.4720]: I know you are Augie.  I know you wanted this evening to be nice.
Ses03M_script02_2_F036 [352.5400-356.9827]: I can't help thinking about being somewhere else.
Ses03M_script02_2_M036 [356.7321-360.3999]: Maybe if you were with someone else too.
Ses03M_script02_2_F037 [359.2836-361.5618]: I didn't say that.
Ses03M_script02_2_M037 [360.5366-365.3662]: I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.
Ses03M_script02_2_F038 [364.6828-370.6743]: Augie
Ses03M_script02_2_M038 [369.6719-372.1323]: Yeah?
Ses03M_script02_2_F039 [371.1982-374.5471]: Yeah.  Don't you know that?
Ses03M_script02_2_F040 [374.6154-384.7303]: If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you.  Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard.
Ses03M_script02_2_M039 [384.2064-390.9041]: Actually
Ses03M_script02_2_F041 [391.1774-399.6521]: Well
Ses03M_script02_2_M040 [401.0873-404.5045]: It seemed like a good spot to me.
Ses03M_script02_2_M041 [404.6184-407.8450]: I mean look at the view of the moon we got from here.
Ses03M_script02_2_F042 [407.0332-411.4072]: Yeah.  I noticed that.  It's real pretty on the water.
Ses03M_script02_2_F043 [411.5211-415.4167]: Big old white moon.
Ses03M_script02_2_M042 [416.2368-420.2919]: Hey
Ses03M_script02_2_F044 [419.6312-422.8025]: Oh you brought refreshments.
Ses03M_script02_2_M043 [421.9549-424.4075]: It's not champagne.
Ses03M_script02_2_F045 [423.6635-427.0352]: Well at least we won't need glasses.
Ses03M_script02_2_M044 [428.3109-432.9811]: Are you still cold?  Do you want to go home?
Ses03M_script02_2_F046 [432.5027-438.0385]: No I'm beginning to think you might be right.
Ses03M_script02_2_F047 [438.6992-443.5060]: I think this may be the place for us after all.
Ses03M_script02_2_F048 [444.3034-447.0144]: I am sorry Augie.
Ses03M_script02_2_M045 [445.1235-451.2517]: Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.
Ses03M_script02_2_F049 [450.0443-454.8511]: Or not.
Ses03M_script02_2_M046 [454.4866-457.2204]: Or not.
Ses03M_script03_1_M000 [012.3161-014.7672]: Good God.
Ses03M_script03_1_F000 [014.1800-015.7750]: Do you think it's them?
Ses03M_script03_1_M001 [015.4600-016.8200]: I wonder.
Ses03M_script03_1_F001 [016.5000-020.2350]: And nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up.
Ses03M_script03_1_M002 [019.8700-021.7625]: Well it must be them then.
Ses03M_script03_1_F002 [021.4000-023.8275]: What are you going to do?
Ses03M_script03_1_M003 [023.5900-027.0800]: We're fine right?  Aren't we?  Whatever happens darling.
Ses03M_script03_1_F003 [026.7100-028.8600]: Now and always sweet.
Ses03M_script03_1_M004 [028.4300-030.1525]: I don't care then.
Ses03M_script03_1_F004 [029.8400-032.9050]: I mean
Ses03M_script03_1_M005 [032.5600-036.4600]: Hello?  Hello?  What?
Ses03M_script03_1_F005 [038.0000-042.6425]: That sent shivers up my spine.
Ses03M_script03_1_M006 [036.4800-038.3300]: No
Ses03M_script03_1_M007 [042.3963-046.5675]: What are we to do if they suddenly walk in on us?
Ses03M_script03_1_F006 [046.2200-048.0100]: Behave exquisitely.
Ses03M_script03_1_M008 [047.5700-049.8600]: With the most perfect poise?
Ses03M_script03_1_F007 [049.4700-053.5200]: Certainly.  And I shall probably do a court courtesy.
Ses03M_script03_1_M009 [053.0100-058.5350]: um- Things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy do they?
Ses03M_script03_1_F008 [058.0900-061.2300]: What is so horrible is that one cannot stay happy.
Ses03M_script03_1_M010 [060.7500-064.3100]: Oh
Ses03M_script03_1_F009 [062.7200-066.4800]: It's true.  I mean
Ses03M_script03_1_M011 [066.2000-069.6950]: You mean that
Ses03M_script03_1_F010 [069.3000-071.8175]: Yes.  I mean just that.
Ses03M_script03_1_M012 [071.6400-079.9448]: What does that all mean?  That's what I asked myself on my quest for ultimate truth.  What does it all mean?
Ses03M_script03_1_F011 [079.1602-082.2426]: Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.
Ses03M_script03_1_M013 [080.1200-085.1600]: [LAUGHTER] Oh
Ses03M_script03_1_F012 [084.7800-086.1800]: Who's they?
Ses03M_script03_1_M014 [085.7800-092.0600]: All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.
Ses03M_script03_1_M015 [092.1000-098.9300]: Laugh at all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings the acid in their damn sweetness and light.
Ses03M_script03_1_F013 [098.6900-103.2750]: So if I'm to laugh at everything then I must laugh at us too.
Ses03M_script03_1_M016 [103.0000-106.7300]: Oh
Ses03M_script03_1_F014 [106.5500-111.1300]: How long will it last?  This ludicrous overbearing love of ours?
Ses03M_script03_1_M017 [111.1200-113.2375]: Who knows?
Ses03M_script03_1_F015 [112.9900-115.5200]: Shall we always want to bicker and fight?
Ses03M_script03_1_M018 [115.1300-119.4400]: No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.
Ses03M_script03_1_F016 [118.7200-121.6175]: Well
Ses03M_script03_1_M019 [121.0200-126.2900]: Well
Ses03M_script03_1_F017 [126.3200-131.1025]: What happens if one of us dies?  I mean
Ses03M_script03_1_M020 [130.5550-134.7850]: Of course
Ses03M_script03_1_F018 [134.0100-135.9700]: That's serious enough.
Ses03M_script03_1_M021 [135.5100-142.1900]: No.  No it isn't.  That's very laughable
Ses03M_script03_1_F019 [141.6300-144.9700]: Darling I believe you're talking nonsense.
Ses03M_script03_1_M022 [144.6400-148.7092]: Oh
Ses03M_script03_1_M023 [148.7800-161.4600]: Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers hmmm?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like quite idiotic school children.
Ses03M_script03_1_M024 [161.4900-169.1750]: Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come kiss me darling before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
Ses03M_script03_1_F020 [168.5425-171.7825]: Elliot
Ses03M_script03_1_M025 [171.9500-178.3675]: I don't care what you do
Ses03M_script03_1_M026 [178.3900-188.9800]: You can put green paint all over your body and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.
Ses03M_script03_1_F021 [188.3100-192.8100]: Thank you dear.  The same applies to you...
Ses03M_script03_1_F022 [192.8400-198.5300]: ...only if you ever so much as look at another woman I'll kill you.
Ses03M_script03_1_M027 [199.1700-202.2600]: Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
Ses03M_script03_1_F023 [201.7400-204.2075]: Which particular one?
Ses03M_script03_1_M028 [203.6175-209.0700]: The one when you bought a little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it in my bed.
Ses03M_script03_1_F024 [208.6800-214.3925]: Charles
Ses03M_script03_1_M029 [214.0800-215.4300]: Horrible little thing.
Ses03M_script03_1_F025 [216.2500-223.1175]: Yeah.  I know you did.  You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
Ses03M_script03_1_M030 [215.4600-216.6500]: I hated it.
M: [BREATHING]
Ses03M_script03_1_M031 [222.9300-225.6700]: How long did that rile last?
Ses03M_script03_1_F026 [225.2300-228.5100]: It went on intermittently for days.
Ses03M_script03_1_M032 [228.0275-231.4800]: Oh
Ses03M_script03_1_F027 [234.2600-238.1252]: I burnt a hole in my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
Ses03M_script03_1_M033 [231.5300-234.5000]: you're curling iron burnt a hole in my dressing gown.
M:[LAUGHTER]
Ses03M_script03_1_M034 [237.5125-240.0300]: That was a rouser wasn't it?
Ses03M_script03_1_F028 [238.5875-244.0700]: [LAUGHTER] Yeah.  That was the first time you ever hit me.
Ses03M_script03_1_M035 [243.5600-245.8100]: I didn't hit you very hard.
Ses03M_script03_1_F029 [245.2000-250.5000]: The manager came in and saw us rolling on the floor
F: [LAUGHTER]
M: [LAUGHTER]
Ses03M_script03_1_M036 [250.2800-255.1061]: I will never forget his face. Ooh-rah [LAUGHTER].
Ses03M_script03_1_F030 [254.5900-258.7875]: How ridiculous.  How utterly
Ses03M_script03_1_M037 [258.7300-260.9800]: We were very much younger then.
Ses03M_script03_1_F031 [260.5700-262.9050]: And much sillier too.
Ses03M_script03_1_M038 [262.9675-268.1800]: The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.
Ses03M_script03_2_M000 [008.0977-013.9804]: Yes.  The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.
Ses03M_script03_2_F000 [013.4546-016.7831]: Oh
Ses03M_script03_2_M001 [016.1538-019.1187]: I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
Ses03M_script03_2_F001 [018.6039-021.6976]: Presents?  A trivial little broach.
Ses03M_script03_2_M002 [020.7010-027.7190]: Mmm Hmm.  I remember it well.  Bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.
Ses03M_script03_2_F002 [026.7431-030.8450]: Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.
Ses03M_script03_2_M003 [030.2521-033.8442]: You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses03M_script03_2_F003 [033.3721-037.7493]: No I didn't.  You made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination.
Ses03M_script03_2_M004 [036.6927-039.7718]: You must admit he was in love with you.
Ses03M_script03_2_F004 [039.2436-042.5038]: Just a little perhaps but nothing serious.
Ses03M_script03_2_M005 [042.1416-046.0325]: You let him kiss you. You said so.  What of it?
Ses03M_script03_2_F005 [043.3641-044.9641]: Well what of it?
Ses03M_script03_2_F006 [045.2810-049.7035]: Well it didn't harm him
Ses03M_script03_2_M006 [048.9035-051.5575]: And what about me?
Ses03M_script03_2_F007 [050.8657-056.1425]: Well
Ses03M_script03_2_M007 [055.5749-058.6389]: Oh
Ses03M_script03_2_F008 [057.9295-062.8954]: Look
Ses03M_script03_2_M008 [062.2500-065.1745]: Yeah
Ses03M_script03_2_M009 [065.2198-067.1065]: You want some brandy?
Ses03M_script03_2_F009 [066.8046-068.2989]: No thanks.
Ses03M_script03_2_M010 [067.6025-069.9441]: I'll have a little I think.
Ses03M_script03_2_F010 [069.2498-072.9025]: I don't know why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.
Ses03M_script03_2_M011 [072.2685-076.4495]: No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.
Ses03M_script03_2_F011 [075.7401-080.1927]: I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing.
Ses03M_script03_2_M012 [079.4984-084.7208]: Oh my...just because I just...okay...
Ses03M_script03_2_M013 [084.7575-091.4828]: ...having three small minute liquor glasses in the evening is hardly going on and on and on.
Ses03M_script03_2_F012 [090.5923-093.6865]: It's become a habit with you.
Ses03M_script03_2_M014 [093.0827-098.0335]: You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.
Ses03M_script03_2_F013 [097.2788-099.6334]: Don't be so stupid.
Ses03M_script03_2_M015 [098.7730-100.6598]: Really Amanda.
Ses03M_script03_2_F014 [100.1617-101.8522]: What?
Ses03M_script03_2_M016 [101.8220-103.7992]: Nothing.
Ses03M_script03_2_F015 [103.6900-105.2215]: [BREATHING]
Ses03M_script03_2_M017 [106.7475-109.0900]: Going out somewhere dear?
Ses03M_script03_2_F016 [108.4750-112.5225]: No
Ses03M_script03_2_M018 [112.1400-114.9988]: That reply has broken my heart.
Ses03M_script03_2_F017 [114.6400-120.1550]: That's the woman's job to lure the man.  Watch me a moment won't you?
Ses03M_script03_2_M019 [119.6476-122.8324]: Actually that's perfectly true.
Ses03M_script03_2_F018 [122.2437-124.6134]: No it isn't.
Ses03M_script03_2_M020 [123.9946-126.0926]: Yes it is.
Ses03M_script03_2_F019 [125.8209-128.3500]: Oh
Ses03M_script03_2_F020 [132.6584-135.6620]: I think you should have some more brandy...
Ses03M_script03_2_M021 [139.2090-141.8655]: I think that
M: Shh.
Ses03M_script03_2_F021 [135.9035-137.3676]: ...cause really
Ses03M_script03_2_F022 [137.3978-139.4656]: it doesn't seem to be working on you.
Ses03M_script03_2_M022 [141.9410-147.4925]: perhaps maybe you should've had more brandy
Ses03M_script03_2_F023 [147.4502-151.0925]: Well it really hasn't worked wonders with you.
Ses03M_script03_2_M023 [150.5293-154.6050]: Hmm
Ses03M_script03_2_F024 [154.1425-156.7227]: Adders don't snap
Ses03M_script03_2_M024 [156.0385-160.0250]: Yes they do.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.
Ses03M_script03_2_F025 [159.4949-161.2911]: They sting.
Ses03M_script03_2_M025 [160.7628-162.0759]: They snap.
Ses03M_script03_2_F026 [161.6080-167.7964]: I don't care.  I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they roll around and bark like hoops.
Ses03M_script03_2_M026 [168.1134-172.1132]: Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
Ses03M_script03_2_F027 [171.5699-174.7850]: Yes
Ses03M_script03_2_M027 [174.1207-177.6979]: I suppose you let him kiss you a great deal more then?
Ses03M_script03_2_F028 [176.4300-178.7394]: Mind your business.
Ses03M_script03_2_M028 [178.2111-187.0107]: Mmm
Ses03M_script03_2_F029 [186.2560-190.2600]: You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.
Ses03M_script03_2_M029 [189.8200-192.2275]: I'm not in the least bit drunk.
Ses03M_script03_2_F030 [191.5992-193.3425]: You've always had a weak head.
Ses03M_script03_2_M030 [192.7161-201.8327]: Okay
Ses03M_script03_2_F031 [201.0327-207.8551]: On the contrary
Ses03M_script03_2_M031 [206.5875-215.1000]: Oh
Ses03M_script03_2_F032 [213.8575-215.7600]: Shut up.
Ses03M_script03_2_M032 [215.2661-220.7050]: We might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.
Ses03M_script03_2_F033 [219.9904-224.3072]: Not very funny dear.  In fact
Ses03M_script03_2_M033 [223.8846-228.2325]: Oh
Ses03M_script03_2_M034 [229.4843-232.2300]: You better turn that off.
Ses03M_script03_2_F034 [231.6427-233.6955]: Why?
Ses03M_script03_2_M035 [232.9710-236.6325]: Because people upstairs will get annoyed.
Ses03M_script03_2_F035 [236.0953-240.4272]: There aren't any people upstairs.  This is a photographer's studio.
Ses03M_script03_2_M036 [239.5971-242.6611]: Well there are people downstairs I suppose.
Ses03M_script03_2_F036 [242.2083-244.3300]: They are away in Tunis.
Ses03M_script03_2_M037 [243.6875-247.2496]: Oh
Ses03M_script03_2_F037 [246.3025-248.3300]: Turn it on again
Ses03M_script03_2_M038 [247.4609-250.1225]: No I'll do no such thing.
Ses03M_script03_2_F038 [249.5575-255.7171]: Very well.  If you insist on being a boorish and idiotic.
Ses03M_script03_2_M039 [257.6642-261.7093]: Come on
Ses03M_script03_2_F039 [260.5924-265.2714]: You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
Ses03M_script03_2_M040 [262.1169-266.1075]: Turn it--Turn it off.
Ses03M_script03_2_F040 [265.5733-269.2550]: Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.
Ses03M_script03_2_M041 [268.6826-271.6259]: Very amusing indeed.
Ses03M_script03_2_F041 [270.8561-280.6670]: I hate you.  Listen I'm sick and tired of listening to you
Ses03M_script03_2_M042 [281.3613-292.6816]: You know what?  You're a vile
Ses03M_script03_2_F042 [291.9269-298.8851]: This is the end.  Understand?  This is the end
Ses03M_script03_2_M043 [298.0475-301.1944]: You're not going nowhere. No you're not.
Ses03M_script03_2_F043 [299.1200-303.2773]: Oh
Ses03M_script03_2_M044 [310.0800-312.0363]: Just shut up.
Ses03M_script03_2_M045 [312.9373-324.9875]: shut up. shut up.  I would-I would never marry you again if you came crawling back to me on your hands and knees because you're an evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never see you again.
Ses03M_script03_2_F044 [303.3226-317.3748]: Listen
Ses03M_script03_2_F045 [324.0160-328.9750]: Beast. Brute. Cad. Swine. Beast. Beast. Brute. Devil. Sorry.
Ses03M_script03_2_M046 [326.7200-328.4838]: Oh.
