Ses01F_impro01_F000 [006.2901-008.2357]: Excuse me.
Ses01F_impro01_M000 [007.5712-010.4750]: Do you have your forms?
Ses01F_impro01_F001 [010.0100-011.3925]: Yeah.
Ses01F_impro01_M001 [010.9266-014.6649]: Let me see them.
Ses01F_impro01_F002 [014.8872-018.0175]: Is there a problem?
Ses01F_impro01_M002 [016.8352-019.7175]: Who told you to get in this line?
Ses01F_impro01_F003 [019.2900-020.7875]: You did.
Ses01F_impro01_F004 [021.3257-024.7400]: You were standing at the beginning and you directed me.
Ses01F_impro01_M003 [023.4700-028.0300]: Okay. But I didn't tell you to get in this line if you are filling out this particular form.
Ses01F_impro01_F005 [027.4600-031.4900]: Well what's the problem?  Let me change it.
Ses01F_impro01_M004 [028.3950-031.2117]: This form is a Z.X.four.
Ses01F_impro01_M005 [031.2660-039.3875]: You can't--  This is not the line for Z.X.four.  If you're going to fill out the Z.X.four
Ses01F_impro01_F006 [038.9650-043.5900]: What?  I'm getting an ID.  This is why I'm here.  My wallet was stolen.
Ses01F_impro01_M006 [041.2300-046.9800]: No. I need another set of ID to prove this is actually you.
Ses01F_impro01_F007 [046.5800-052.1900]: How am I supposed to get an ID without an ID?  How does a person get an ID in the first place?
Ses01F_impro01_M007 [051.4000-057.6400]: I don't know.  But I need an ID to pass this form along.  I can't just send it along without an ID.
Ses01F_impro01_F008 [056.1600-058.8225]: I'm here to get an ID.
Ses01F_impro01_M008 [058.1800-062.5900]: No.  I need another ID
Ses01F_impro01_F009 [061.8700-065.9700]: Like what?  Like a birth certificate?
Ses01F_impro01_M009 [065.5100-073.0000]: A birth certificate
Ses01F_impro01_F010 [066.4200-069.3400]: Who the hell has a birth certificate?
Ses01F_impro01_F011 [072.4500-082.2600]: Yes but my wallet was stolen
Ses01F_impro01_M010 [081.5900-086.0300]: Yeah.  We keep it on file
Ses01F_impro01_F012 [085.2700-088.0200]: That's out of control.
Ses01F_impro01_M011 [087.1500-094.3900]: I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here.  It's just a simple form.  I just need an ID.
Ses01F_impro01_F013 [093.6700-097.0218]: How long have you been working here?
Ses01F_impro01_M012 [095.8600-098.6800]: Actually too long.
Ses01F_impro01_F014 [097.8900-102.9600]: Clearly.  You know
Ses01F_impro01_M013 [101.8400-107.8700]: Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Huh? Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Fine.  I'll be right back.
Ses01F_impro01_F015 [103.9700-106.7100]: That would - I would appreciate that.  Yeah.
Ses01F_impro02_F000 [007.2688-016.6000]: Did you get the mail? So you saw my letter?
M: Yeah.
Ses01F_impro02_M000 [017.6000-020.6264]: It's not fair.
Ses01F_impro02_F001 [019.8500-022.7800]: Yeah.  I know.
Ses01F_impro02_M001 [021.7600-027.5558]: I don't understand.  You've already done so much
Ses01F_impro02_F002 [026.5659-032.2895]: I don't know.  I put in that. request too. They didn't...
Ses01F_impro02_F003 [032.3075-037.9600]: I guess
Ses01F_impro02_M002 [038.8500-045.0900]: I don't know
Ses01F_impro02_F004 [047.3400-053.1100]: There's people that have given more though
Ses01F_impro02_M003 [052.7100-059.0534]: I just don't see how they can make you leave when you have a new baby - we have a new kid.
Ses01F_impro02_F005 [058.7500-061.3100]: I know.
Ses01F_impro02_M004 [061.7500-065.0550]: Then why is that fair?  Why--
Ses01F_impro02_F006 [064.2550-068.4700]: There's babies over there
Ses01F_impro02_M005 [069.3400-074.2900]: I don't know how you can be okay with this?  I don't know why you're not-- you're fine with it.
Ses01F_impro02_F007 [072.3900-078.5700]: I'm not okay with it
Ses01F_impro02_M006 [080.0300-086.9900]: I'm just trying to think of another way.  I'm just trying to...
Ses01F_impro02_F008 [087.2031-091.0900]: Just
Ses01F_impro02_F009 [091.5500-095.8800]: like you sign up because you need money and
Ses01F_impro02_F010 [097.9400-102.1900]: things just aren't what they seem.
Ses01F_impro02_M007 [103.2700-107.1000]: This is a stupid war.
Ses01F_impro02_F011 [107.6800-111.0153]: We're doing the right thing
Ses01F_impro02_M008 [110.5653-113.2000]: I know.
Ses01F_impro02_M009 [114.1775-117.8500]: I just don't see why it has to be you.
Ses01F_impro02_F012 [117.8300-120.8605]: If not me then
Ses01F_impro02_M010 [120.4105-124.6300]: What am I going to do? Huh?
Ses01F_impro02_F013 [127.8200-133.9455]: You'll videotape everything
Ses01F_impro02_M011 [133.8800-137.1000]: Yeah.
Ses01F_impro02_F014 [139.0300-146.4300]: Maybe you can send it to me
Ses01F_impro02_M012 [147.0300-151.7101]: Don't you guys have access to computers over there.
Ses01F_impro02_F015 [151.4221-155.0100]: Last month--  Yeah.
Ses01F_impro02_M013 [157.9800-162.7100]: I just don't know how I'm going to do it without you.
Ses01F_impro02_F016 [163.5400-165.7300]: I have to find sitters.
Ses01F_impro02_M014 [164.8850-169.5000]: I can't raise a baby by myself.  How?
Ses01F_impro02_F017 [169.3600-176.0150]: We've got friends
Ses01F_impro02_M015 [175.4700-176.7200]: I know.
Ses01F_impro02_F018 [176.0800-179.1300]: And your mother is close by.
Ses01F_impro02_F019 [182.8300-185.8894]: I'll send you lots of letters.
Ses01F_impro02_F020 [186.5800-191.1100]: And I want lots and lots and lots of pictures.
Ses01F_impro02_M016 [195.1047-199.5200]: It's just not fair.
Ses01F_impro03_M000 [003.2400-005.4600]: So what's up?  What's new?
Ses01F_impro03_F000 [004.8800-007.7400]: Well Vegas was awesome.
Ses01F_impro03_M001 [006.6000-008.6600]: Yeah.  I heard.
Ses01F_impro03_F001 [007.9300-011.3700]: And
Ses01F_impro03_M002 [010.5300-013.8400]: Shut up.  No- in Vegas?
Ses01F_impro03_F002 [012.8000-015.3700]: Yeah.  In the old town part.
Ses01F_impro03_M003 [014.9300-018.9075]: Who did you marry?
Ses01F_impro03_F003 [015.8700-020.4867]: Chuck. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_impro03_M004 [020.2532-022.8300]: Did you propose to you?
Ses01F_impro03_F004 [021.7500-025.5200]: Um- Yes.  It was very romantic.
Ses01F_impro03_F005 [025.5584-028.1400]: It was at the slot machines.
Ses01F_impro03_M005 [027.2800-029.6500]: Oh.  The Wheel of Fortune slots?
Ses01F_impro03_F006 [028.3700-034.7100]: Uhuh
Ses01F_impro03_M006 [034.2500-036.3400]: He turned to you and was like...
Ses01F_impro03_F007 [035.6349-040.1000]: Hey.  Let's get married and I said okay.
Ses01F_impro03_M007 [037.7175-040.4700]: [LAUGHTER] That's really romantic.
Ses01F_impro03_F008 [040.1200-042.7900]: Yeah.  Well.  You know
Ses01F_impro03_M008 [042.0900-043.4100]: Yeah.
Ses01F_impro03_F009 [042.8400-044.5400]: But we're going to have a honeymoon cruise.
Ses01F_impro03_M009 [044.1600-049.0700]: Does that mean that you're going to get citizenship
Ses01F_impro03_F010 [047.8700-051.0750]: Oh.  I hadn't even thought about that.
Ses01F_impro03_M010 [049.6100-052.4300]: Yeah.  Think about that.
Ses01F_impro03_F011 [051.3600-053.4925]: He's not going to be a citizen
Ses01F_impro03_M011 [052.9200-056.8500]: Yeah.  But he'll have like a long visa.  Can you go visit then for a long time?
M: I think you can.
Ses01F_impro03_F012 [055.8650-058.1500]: Oh.  Totally.
M: Yeah. 
Ses01F_impro03_M012 [057.4600-061.3750]: Oh
Ses01F_impro03_F013 [060.7300-065.8600]: I guess I'll-  I guess I'll have an internet husband.[LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_impro03_M013 [065.6425-068.4400]: Like you need another one of those.[LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_impro03_F014 [068.0100-073.7500]: I have an internet boyfriend.  I guess I'll have to juggle the two.  Is that cheating?  I don't know. Hmm.
Ses01F_impro03_M014 [073.4100-076.9975]: Is that your phone?
Ses01F_impro03_F015 [074.2675-078.8425]: Yeah
Ses01F_impro03_M015 [078.3200-080.5000]: He loves you.
Ses01F_impro03_F016 [079.0350-081.0875]: He likes to keep tabs
Ses01F_impro03_M016 [080.7175-082.5225]: How much did he win at the slot?
Ses01F_impro03_F017 [082.0975-085.0800]: Uh
Ses01F_impro03_M017 [084.6925-087.3600]: Really? Penny slots?
Ses01F_impro03_F018 [085.1000-088.0225]: Penny slots. That's what he plays.
Ses01F_impro03_M018 [087.6425-089.0800]: Wow.
Ses01F_impro03_F019 [088.0800-089.5000]: Yeah.
Ses01F_impro03_M019 [089.1200-093.9100]: I'm a big fan of the Wheel of Fortune quarters. But it just costs so much.  I don't know.
Ses01F_impro03_F020 [091.2350-092.6150]: Oh.
Ses01F_impro03_F021 [092.7500-098.2100]: Yeah.  We played Wheel of Fortune pennies.  It's like a giant thing with like-
Ses01F_impro03_M020 [097.0300-101.6500]: But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like
Ses01F_impro03_F022 [099.7775-102.0300]: Fifty bucks. Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro03_M021 [101.6700-104.3500]: like
Ses01F_impro03_F023 [102.6200-103.4625]: Yeah.
Ses01F_impro03_F024 [103.7800-108.1825]: Well so now we're married. We have cat children.
Ses01F_impro03_M022 [105.2900-106.9500]: Awesome.
Ses01F_impro03_M023 [107.7100-111.4000]: [LAUGHTER] Cat babies.
Ses01F_impro03_F025 [110.2300-114.1600]: We renamed Brenda
Ses01F_impro03_M024 [117.3600-119.5800]: That's fair enough.
Ses01F_impro03_F026 [114.1900-120.2000]: She needs a new name each state that we go into. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_impro04_M000 [002.7418-006.6575]: Have you tried
Ses01F_impro04_F000 [007.2455-011.6400]: Uh
Ses01F_impro04_M001 [010.4600-012.1300]: Yeah.
Ses01F_impro04_F001 [011.7448-016.1500]: I don't know.  Isn't that-- that's all like escort services and things like that.
Ses01F_impro04_M002 [015.6400-018.9000]: No.  There's regular jobs on there.
Ses01F_impro04_F002 [018.6000-030.8976]: I don't know.  I mean I've been looking for so long that I just figured that--  I mean
Ses01F_impro04_M003 [026.9100-028.7100]: Uh huh.
Ses01F_impro04_M004 [030.8800-035.5225]: I'm just saying I have a friend that got a good job on it so I was just recommending it.
Ses01F_impro04_F003 [035.0090-037.8000]: What kind of a job?
Ses01F_impro04_M005 [037.1900-040.5300]: He's like a manager for a theatre.
Ses01F_impro04_F004 [040.2300-041.9500]: Really?
Ses01F_impro04_M006 [040.5400-043.5760]: He's like a house manager. Yeah.  It's a good job.
Ses01F_impro04_F005 [043.3500-045.7596]: He just...
Ses01F_impro04_F006 [046.2735-049.8300]: you know what?  I heard about that job.  I applied for that.
Ses01F_impro04_M007 [049.3900-050.5800]: You did?
Ses01F_impro04_F007 [050.1100-054.3100]: Yeah.  I saw a posting at the theatre.
Ses01F_impro04_M008 [055.2100-056.3300]: Yeah.
M: Hmm.
Ses01F_impro04_F008 [054.3700-055.6700]: He got it?
Ses01F_impro04_M009 [056.3500-059.0245]: You've been looking for a job for a long time; that was a long time ago.  Right?
Ses01F_impro04_F009 [058.7100-060.0937]: Yeah.
Ses01F_impro04_M010 [059.8000-061.5500]: Hmm.
Ses01F_impro04_F010 [060.6771-066.5275]: What did he do?  What was so great?  I don't understand why they would pick him over me.
Ses01F_impro04_M011 [065.9700-069.7700]: I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and--
Ses01F_impro04_F011 [069.4300-070.9400]: A resume?
Ses01F_impro04_M012 [070.3800-072.7264]: Yeah.  Do you have a resume?
Ses01F_impro04_F012 [072.1300-074.7300]: No.
Ses01F_impro04_M013 [073.7473-077.1500]: It's kind of helpful when getting a job.
Ses01F_impro04_F013 [076.4900-080.7269]: I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at.
Ses01F_impro04_M014 [080.1435-087.8100]: Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out.
Ses01F_impro04_F014 [085.4900-086.9800]: Yeah.
Ses01F_impro04_F015 [087.2203-093.3300]: I don't like- I don't like sending things in the mail.  I don't want my information out there.
Ses01F_impro04_M015 [092.3700-099.2700]: No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need
Ses01F_impro04_F016 [097.4100-101.0475]: I'm there in front of them.  I'm telling them what I'm good at.
Ses01F_impro04_M016 [100.4850-103.4700]: Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps
Ses01F_impro04_F017 [102.7800-105.4150]: Why?  It's a piece of paper.
Ses01F_impro04_M017 [104.9700-107.7800]: No.  But it has an outline
Ses01F_impro04_F018 [106.1700-111.8600]: I just don't want this paper trail
Ses01F_impro04_M018 [111.6600-117.7250]: I know.  Okay.  Well
Ses01F_impro04_F019 [114.9200-122.3100]: It's just-- You know
Ses01F_impro04_M019 [118.4600-119.7700]: Yeah.
Ses01F_impro04_M020 [121.5000-123.4200]: Okay
Ses01F_impro04_F020 [122.4000-129.9300]: ..I just-..I just think it's kind of prejudiced and they are really discriminating against people who just aren't that way.
Ses01F_impro04_M021 [129.4300-139.1600]: Well
Ses01F_impro04_F021 [133.7400-137.4400]: That's baloney
Ses01F_impro04_F022 [138.1300-139.8900]: Please.
Ses01F_impro04_M022 [139.5219-141.8225]: maybe get a car.
Ses01F_impro04_M023 [144.9125-149.5100]: I just
Ses01F_impro04_F023 [148.5500-152.8500]: you think that you're better than me because I don't have a car?
Ses01F_impro04_M024 [151.8400-154.0300]: I didn't say that.
Ses01F_impro04_F024 [153.1800-155.2925]: You know
Ses01F_impro04_M025 [154.6000-157.8000]: I am riding the bus
Ses01F_impro04_F025 [157.1625-159.7000]: Why?  What choice?
Ses01F_impro04_M026 [158.9500-161.3500]: To save the environment
Ses01F_impro04_F026 [161.0787-163.7800]: You're saving the environment. mmhmm
Ses01F_impro04_M027 [162.1200-164.7825]: Yes.  One less car at a time.
Ses01F_impro04_F027 [164.3925-167.5650]: Interesting.  That's fantastic.
Ses01F_impro04_M028 [165.4700-166.7100]: Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro04_M029 [167.0500-171.4300]: You know
Ses01F_impro04_F028 [170.8300-172.8400]: I'm not frustrated.
Ses01F_impro04_M030 [171.7500-175.2600]: ...you can't get a job and refuse to have a resume.
Ses01F_impro04_F029 [175.2700-178.4300]: Who do you think you are?
Ses01F_impro04_M031 [178.0033-180.8650]: I don't think I'm anyone.
Ses01F_impro04_F030 [180.3025-183.4875]: You are so high and mighty.  I just--
Ses01F_impro04_M032 [182.8200-185.5400]: I- I-I didn't-- okay.
Ses01F_impro04_F031 [184.4700-188.8700]: Oh.  I'm saving the environment. I'm riding this car because I- I want to.
Ses01F_impro04_M033 [186.1200-187.4625]: What?  No.
Ses01F_impro04_M034 [188.0100-190.7100]: What? Oh.  So now you're...
Ses01F_impro04_F032 [189.1200-192.0200]: The bus
Ses01F_impro04_M035 [191.2800-195.1300]: you know what?  You don't have to take your anger and your hurt out on me.
Ses01F_impro04_F033 [193.5875-199.4325]: I can not-- you are not here by choice.  Nobody would ride this bus by choice.
Ses01F_impro04_M036 [200.2150-202.0825]: Why not?
Ses01F_impro05_F000 [004.2400-005.2300]: Hi.
Ses01F_impro05_M000 [003.6100-005.1900]: Hi.  Thanks for waiting.
Ses01F_impro05_F001 [005.2600-007.1600]: Yeah. This is the fourth line that I have been in.
Ses01F_impro05_M001 [005.2100-006.4400]: Can I help you?
Ses01F_impro05_M002 [006.6000-007.7100]: Uh huh.
Ses01F_impro05_F002 [007.3500-008.8500]: I need my bag.
Ses01F_impro05_M003 [008.3200-009.8000]: Okay.
Ses01F_impro05_F003 [009.2000-013.0200]: I flew in over three hours ago
Ses01F_impro05_M004 [012.2600-013.7800]: Okay.
Ses01F_impro05_F004 [013.0400-022.7400]: I waited the entire baggage- I waited for the whole baggage carousel four times.  They told me to go to the next one.  I waited through that for three planes and now I'm here.
Ses01F_impro05_M005 [021.8400-025.9000]: Okay.  Great.  I'm really sorry that you had to do that.  What's your last name?  Let's start there.
Ses01F_impro05_F005 [025.3500-026.7600]: Nash.
Ses01F_impro05_M006 [025.9900-027.7272]: Okay.
Ses01F_impro05_F006 [028.2400-029.9100]: No G.
Ses01F_impro05_M007 [028.2900-034.1425]: all right- okay.  And you lost your bag? Is that- that the issue?
Ses01F_impro05_F007 [032.1900-033.5000]: Yes.
Ses01F_impro05_F008 [033.7800-035.9000]: Flight seven fourteen.
Ses01F_impro05_M008 [034.7000-036.5200]: Uh-huh.
Ses01F_impro05_F009 [036.7100-044.0300]: Am I going to be getting
Ses01F_impro05_M009 [036.9100-042.7600]: Yeah. Yeah
Ses01F_impro05_M010 [043.8600-049.9700]: I don't see any record of it
Ses01F_impro05_M011 [049.9700-070.2600]: we've mistakenly lost your baggage.  We're very sorry.  On behalf of Jet Blue I would like to apologize for any inconvenience.  I am allowed to issue you a fifty dollar gift card which you can use any future flights you want to take with us.  I'm very sorry
Ses01F_impro05_F010 [069.5500-073.7600]: Oh
Ses01F_impro05_M012 [070.3800-073.1400]: for such an inconvenience and your bag
Ses01F_impro05_F011 [073.8700-075.5375]: Is this a joke?
Ses01F_impro05_M013 [073.5500-074.9900]: Yeah.
Ses01F_impro05_M014 [075.0300-076.4800]: No
Ses01F_impro05_F012 [075.6100-080.7300]: Are there candid cameras?  Is this that movie? There's that show
Ses01F_impro05_M015 [080.2200-083.2425]: No
Ses01F_impro05_F013 [082.7500-086.0600]: So you'll give me money and then I'll get my bag?
Ses01F_impro05_M016 [085.7200-093.9575]: No.  I'm just giving you money
Ses01F_impro05_M017 [094.0050-100.4000]: this is the only track record that we have and if it's not listed here then it's probably not anywhere.
Ses01F_impro05_F014 [099.5200-102.9000]: You're kidding me
Ses01F_impro05_M018 [100.5500-103.6800]: Once again
Ses01F_impro05_F015 [103.0050-118.5000]: Do you have any idea-- fifty dollars?  That's supposed to replace everything that I have?  Do you understand how much I have packed in there? Not only does it have sentimental value; it can't be replaced like that.  It was incredibly expensive.
Ses01F_impro05_M019 [111.2800-112.8100]: Yes.
Ses01F_impro05_M020 [118.0400-119.3700]: I know.
Ses01F_impro05_F016 [118.5300-122.4400]: We flew in from Paris.  I've been shopping for three weeks.
Ses01F_impro05_M021 [121.1900-129.2300]: I'm very sorry.  But if you see the sign that's right behind me here
Ses01F_impro05_F017 [127.4850-136.8500]: I don't care what you're freaking sign says.  Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience.
Ses01F_impro05_M022 [131.0200-133.2500]: Okay. Calm-
Ses01F_impro05_M023 [136.1900-143.5000]: Actually
Ses01F_impro05_F018 [137.7150-140.1100]: Do you understand who my husband is?
Ses01F_impro05_F019 [140.2250-145.6000]: If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit
Ses01F_impro05_M024 [144.8500-151.1600]: We are actually not even allowed--  you know
Ses01F_impro05_F020 [149.3650-153.8000]: Oh-Oh.  It's a gift.  You're-You're helping me out here?
Ses01F_impro05_M025 [151.3350-152.7100]: It's a gift.
Ses01F_impro05_M026 [152.8325-158.5800]: You know
Ses01F_impro05_F021 [155.6000-160.3600]: You are cruising for a bruising.  You are in so much trouble.
Ses01F_impro05_M027 [159.6600-161.3700]: With the amount of--
Ses01F_impro05_F022 [160.4100-163.7975]: Who's in charge?  Who is the president of Jet Blue?
Ses01F_impro05_M028 [163.2500-166.9900]: Um
Ses01F_impro05_F023 [163.8800-165.8000]: Because I probably know him.
Ses01F_impro05_F024 [166.3300-167.7100]: Yeah.
Ses01F_impro05_M029 [167.1500-173.6300]: Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do--
Ses01F_impro05_F025 [171.0900-174.2000]: I don't want money
Ses01F_impro05_M030 [173.7325-178.2625]: Right now all I can do is just give you this fifty dollars
Ses01F_impro05_F026 [177.6025-179.0900]: What's your name?
Ses01F_impro05_M031 [178.5900-180.8700]: Oh.  My name is Sean. Hi.
Ses01F_impro05_F027 [179.2200-183.8450]: Sean.  Great. Do you have a badge number or something?
Ses01F_impro05_M032 [183.1400-189.3875]: Badge number?  Uh
Ses01F_impro05_F028 [188.7800-190.8975]: Okay.  I'll do that.
Ses01F_impro05_M033 [190.2300-196.9000]: Why?  Have I done something wrong?  Have I given you bad service?  I feel like I have done the best I could.
Ses01F_impro05_F029 [195.3800-199.3300]: I don't think you have done everything you could do because I don't have my bag here yet.
Ses01F_impro05_M034 [198.6600-205.1700]: If you want
Ses01F_impro05_F030 [202.8600-206.1700]: A letter? I'll make a personal phone call.
Ses01F_impro05_M035 [205.6300-211.9400]: Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression
Ses01F_impro06_M000 [011.4600-014.7400]: I'm sorry
Ses01F_impro06_F000 [014.7939-018.1700]: It's okay.
Ses01F_impro06_M001 [018.4900-024.9100]: Is there anything I can get you?  Do you want me to take care of anything for you or...?
Ses01F_impro06_F001 [024.0200-025.6900]: No
Ses01F_impro06_M002 [025.1200-026.5600]: ...pick up anything?
Ses01F_impro06_F002 [026.0700-027.6500]: No.
Ses01F_impro06_M003 [028.9700-035.0200]: You know you are welcome to stay at my house if you want to just check out for a couple days and hang out.
Ses01F_impro06_F003 [034.4500-035.7800]: That's sweet.
Ses01F_impro06_F004 [036.0700-038.0400]: Thank you.
Ses01F_impro06_F005 [039.6025-046.2900]: I went to see her headstone a week or two ago.
Ses01F_impro06_F006 [047.3400-059.3800]: I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died.  I just
Ses01F_impro06_M004 [056.1700-057.4900]: Hmm.
Ses01F_impro06_F007 [059.4525-067.4525]: So I was like wandering around before.  It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know.
Ses01F_impro06_F008 [070.2200-080.1300]: So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone.  And-
F:Umm.
Ses01F_impro06_F009 [080.1600-087.7400]: this woman came up and
Ses01F_impro06_M005 [086.9600-088.6300]: Oh.  She was there?
Ses01F_impro06_F010 [087.8300-093.6700]: Yeah.  And she was like
Ses01F_impro06_F011 [101.8300-116.9100]: And I
Ses01F_impro06_M006 [107.7800-109.2700]: Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro06_F012 [117.0700-126.0400]: I don't know.  It just
Ses01F_impro06_M007 [125.4700-127.1900]: Yeah.
Ses01F_impro06_F013 [132.9575-134.4900]: I don't know.
Ses01F_impro06_M008 [134.4000-136.4900]: How long were you there for?
Ses01F_impro06_F014 [135.9600-137.9500]: At the cemetery?
Ses01F_impro06_M009 [137.0900-138.4400]: Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro06_F015 [138.0685-141.0500]: couple hours.
Ses01F_impro06_F016 [141.8400-149.4375]: I brought- I brought Chuck with me. He went to Redlands
Ses01F_impro06_M010 [144.0900-145.6800]: Oh really?
Ses01F_impro06_M011 [155.0700-158.3800]: You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery?
Ses01F_impro06_F017 [158.0800-163.3500]: It was hot.[LIPSMACK]
Ses01F_impro06_M012 [165.6100-168.1000]: Is it a big cemetery?
Ses01F_impro06_F018 [167.6400-174.8400]: Yeah.  It's huge.  Redlands is an old city so they have lots and lots of stones.
Ses01F_impro06_M013 [174.3900-177.1500]: Oh
Ses01F_impro06_F019 [176.3500-178.0100]: Yeah.
Ses01F_impro06_F020 [182.5600-197.7300]: It's weird.  Whenever I go back to town
Ses01F_impro06_F021 [197.7550-214.3400]: My best friend Heather.  She's got a- we have a- we built this like little--  There's a park
Ses01F_impro06_F022 [217.5000-222.4100]: She used to have these poetry parties on Memorial Day.
Ses01F_impro06_M014 [219.7300-221.0300]: Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro06_F023 [223.5200-227.5500]: Umm. Yeah.
Ses01F_impro06_F024 [229.0800-235.9800]: And the last time before she died
Ses01F_impro06_F025 [237.5300-256.4800]: But I mean she could
Ses01F_impro06_M015 [255.3500-257.3100]: Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro06_F026 [266.5500-275.3100]: Some
F:Mmhmm.

Ses01F_impro06_F027 [275.3800-281.6000]: There's another one
Ses01F_impro06_F028 [282.0100-311.1400]: I remember
Ses01F_impro06_M017 [308.2400-310.0100]: Mmhmm.Mmhmm.Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro07_M000 [002.9700-004.7800]: Did you get the letter?
Ses01F_impro07_F000 [003.9500-010.5900]: Yes.  There's a big envelope it says

Ses01F_impro07_F004 [037.1625-042.4900]: I don't know.  I spend so much time commuting as it is
Ses01F_impro07_M005 [041.1700-046.9975]: This is so- I am so happy that you're going to stay.  You're not going to...We should totally throw a party.
Ses01F_impro07_F005 [042.9550-045.8850]: I know. We should throw a party.
Ses01F_impro07_F006 [046.2800-055.4100]: At Arapaho we could afford that. [GARBAGE]. Yeah.  So what are you doing this summer
Ses01F_impro07_M006 [047.1100-052.8125]: A rapper party ho. Yeah. Okay.

F:Yay.  
Ses01F_impro07_F007 [063.0200-072.7500]: It's a relief too. I mean I was thinking I was going to have to pack up all of my stuff but yeah. Hooray for U.S.C.
Ses01F_impro07_M008 [064.6275-067.2400]: Yeah.  Big time.

Ses01F_impro07_M019 [128.5400-141.6850]: That's how you get the big bucks.  Are you messing with the chair? Don't ruin it.
Ses01F_impro07_F016 [133.3125-142.3625]: I know. I made such a mess of it
Ses01F_script01_1_F000 [006.2100-009.3200]: What's he going to say?
Ses01F_script01_1_F001 [009.3500-012.8955]: Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.
Ses01F_script01_1_M000 [011.9892-015.1219]: He saw it.
Ses01F_script01_1_F002 [014.3063-019.5526]: How could he see it?  I was the first one up; he was still in bed.
Ses01F_script01_1_M001 [019.0456-022.3962]: He was out here when it broke.
Ses01F_script01_1_F003 [022.3200-024.6667]: When?
Ses01F_script01_1_M002 [024.8000-035.9971]: Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked.
Ses01F_script01_1_F004 [035.3799-039.0900]: What was he doing out here at four o clock in the morning?
Ses01F_script01_1_M003 [038.6600-040.5300]: I don't know.
Ses01F_script01_1_F005 [040.0200-044.9688]: He's dreaming of him again
Ses01F_script01_1_M004 [044.5500-047.2300]: I guess he is.
Ses01F_script01_1_F006 [046.9500-052.3200]: It's getting to be just like after he died.  What's the meaning of that?
Ses01F_script01_1_M005 [051.4300-059.5500]: I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing
Ses01F_script01_1_F007 [058.9500-060.8800]: What?
Ses01F_script01_1_M006 [062.1628-068.2500]: Being dishonest with him
Ses01F_script01_1_F008 [067.6000-070.6700]: What do you mean dishonest?
Ses01F_script01_1_M007 [070.0764-078.8718]: You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?
Ses01F_script01_1_F009 [078.3648-081.5611]: What do you want to do?  Argue with him?
Ses01F_script01_1_M008 [081.4068-089.4307]: I don't want to argue but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive.
Ses01F_script01_1_M009 [089.7172-101.3800]: You know?  Why shouldn't he walk the nights thinking of him
Ses01F_script01_1_F010 [100.1400-102.3482]: You can't say that to him.
Ses01F_script01_1_M010 [102.1000-104.7200]: We've got to say it to him.
Ses01F_script01_1_F011 [104.2900-108.7408]: Where's the proof?  Do you have any proof?
Ses01F_script01_1_M011 [108.1897-118.4700]: For God's sake
Ses01F_script01_1_F012 [117.8228-129.5100]: To you it is
Ses01F_script01_1_M012 [130.7600-134.5900]: Sit down
Ses01F_script01_1_F013 [134.0100-141.9500]: It's that the trouble is those God damn newspapers.  Every month some new boy comes back and so the next one is going to be Larry
Ses01F_script01_1_M013 [141.0500-149.7500]: All right
Ses01F_script01_1_F014 [150.2700-152.6736]: Why?
Ses01F_script01_1_M014 [153.8860-155.8699]: You know.
Ses01F_script01_1_F015 [156.1786-160.6700]: Well I got an idea
Ses01F_script01_1_M015 [161.9980-165.3487]: I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses01F_script01_1_F016 [165.6573-169.5590]: Well that's only your business
Ses01F_script01_1_M016 [169.7574-172.1800]: You know it's not just my business.
Ses01F_script01_1_F017 [171.6300-175.4900]: Well what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
Ses01F_script01_1_M017 [174.7833-177.7200]: So all right then
Ses01F_script01_1_F018 [176.9600-179.7500]: Well you want to make sure that your father is not going to --
Ses01F_script01_1_M018 [179.2800-181.9475]: Then it's not just my business.
Ses01F_script01_1_F019 [183.9800-186.0500]: I'm just saying.
Ses01F_script01_1_M019 [185.0300-195.2800]: You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God
Ses01F_script01_1_F020 [194.0600-198.9100]: Oh.  I ignore what I got to ignore.  That girl is Larry's girl.
Ses01F_script01_1_M020 [197.6000-199.7475]: She's not Larry's girl.
F: Line.
M: From mother's point of view
Ses01F_script01_1_F021 [205.1600-215.1700]: From your father's point of view
F: From...line.
M: Now you can go on from here.
Ses01F_script01_1_F022 [219.0400-223.8200]: Now you can go on from there if you know where to go
Ses01F_script01_1_M021 [224.7000-236.0500]: I don't know why it is
F: You're --
Ses01F_script01_1_F023 [235.2000-238.5600]: You're a considerate fellow
Ses01F_script01_1_M022 [237.8000-240.4290]: To hell with that.
Ses01F_script01_1_F024 [241.3769-245.1904]: I just don't see why.  Have you asked Annie yet?
Ses01F_script01_1_M023 [245.2786-247.5700]: I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses01F_script01_1_F025 [246.8000-251.4508]: Well how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.
Ses01F_script01_1_M024 [251.2965-261.0500]: Well if she does
Ses01F_script01_1_M025 [262.6500-267.2119]: And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.
Ses01F_script01_1_F026 [266.8300-270.7300]: The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.
Ses01F_script01_1_M026 [269.7300-274.6626]: So what.  I'm not fast with women.
Ses01F_script01_1_F027 [274.1997-277.2100]: Why does it have to be Annie?
Ses01F_script01_1_M027 [276.2400-278.3659]: Because it is.
Ses01F_script01_1_F028 [278.1500-282.5900]: Oh that's a great reason.  It's no reason at all.
Ses01F_script01_1_M028 [281.5700-283.8900]: I don't know.
Ses01F_script01_1_F029 [282.7300-286.9200]: You haven't seen her since you went away to war
Ses01F_script01_1_M029 [285.9600-296.0300]: I can't help it
Ses01F_script01_1_M030 [297.0000-300.0700]: Mom
Ses01F_script01_1_F030 [299.3100-302.1950]: I don't want a diagram.
Ses01F_script01_1_F031 [304.2300-308.9800]: He thinks he's coming back Chris.
Ses01F_script01_1_F032 [309.0400-312.7098]: You marry that girl
Ses01F_script01_1_F033 [312.7400-318.2648]: ...and then what's that going to do to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.
Ses01F_script01_1_M031 [318.2868-321.9800]: All right
Ses01F_script01_1_F034 [323.3348-326.0750]: Just give it some more thought.
Ses01F_script01_1_M032 [325.7300-336.5389]: I've given it three years of thought.  And I'd hope that if I waited
Ses01F_script01_1_M033 [336.7373-342.3143]: But if I can't do that here
Ses01F_script01_1_F035 [341.9700-344.8052]: What the hell is this?
Ses01F_script01_1_M034 [344.4966-350.1500]: I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else
Ses01F_script01_1_F036 [349.6300-352.5866]: Are you crazy?
Ses01F_script01_1_M035 [352.1016-356.8800]: I've been a good son for too long
Ses01F_script01_1_F037 [356.4000-359.8700]: You have a business here.  What the hell is this?
Ses01F_script01_1_M036 [359.0300-362.8200]: The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses01F_script01_1_F038 [361.8100-364.6100]: Oh.  Must you be inspired?
Ses01F_script01_1_M037 [363.8700-373.5675]: Yes.  I like it for an hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long
Ses01F_script01_1_M038 [373.5975-383.1500]: I want some kids
Ses01F_script01_1_F039 [382.6000-387.9700]: You mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this?
Ses01F_script01_1_M039 [387.5000-390.1100]: On this
Ses01F_script01_1_F040 [389.5400-392.9042]: Well you don't want to think like that.
Ses01F_script01_1_M040 [392.3100-395.6900]: Then help me stay here.
Ses01F_script01_1_F041 [394.9100-404.6900]: All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for
Ses01F_script01_1_M041 [403.4300-407.0400]: I know that.  Then just help me stay here.
Ses01F_script01_1_F042 [406.3900-409.4600]: Just don't think like that.
Ses01F_script01_1_M042 [408.9600-412.8536]: Well I am thinking like that.
Ses01F_script01_1_F043 [412.7875-416.2484]: I don't understand you
Ses01F_script01_1_M043 [415.9200-420.4807]: No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses01F_script01_1_F044 [420.3500-423.2141]: I can see that.
Ses01F_script01_2_F000 [006.7800-010.5900]: Why did he invite her here?
Ses01F_script01_2_M000 [010.0840-013.4800]: Why does that bother you?
Ses01F_script01_2_F001 [012.7100-017.2300]: She's been in New York three and an half years
Ses01F_script01_2_M001 [016.6300-021.6600]: Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her.
Ses01F_script01_2_F002 [021.2500-026.4100]: Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
Ses01F_script01_2_M002 [025.7300-033.0800]: What do you mean?  You know he lived next door to the girl his whole life
Ses01F_script01_2_M003 [033.6200-040.5200]: [BREATHING] You don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything more than he told you.
Ses01F_script01_2_F003 [039.9300-042.9600]: He's not going to marry her.
Ses01F_script01_2_M004 [042.4400-045.2400]: How do you know he's even thinking about it?
Ses01F_script01_2_F004 [044.3500-046.3000]: It's got that about it.
Ses01F_script01_2_M005 [045.8000-047.5900]: Oh.  So what.
Ses01F_script01_2_F005 [047.1000-050.8500]: What is going on here
Ses01F_script01_2_M006 [050.6000-052.5500]: Now listen.
Ses01F_script01_2_F006 [052.0300-056.4200]: She is not his girl.  She knows she's not.
Ses01F_script01_2_M007 [055.8700-058.2000]: You can't read her mind.
Ses01F_script01_2_F007 [057.7600-066.6500]: Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men
Ses01F_script01_2_M008 [066.1000-068.3100]: How do you know why she waited?
Ses01F_script01_2_F008 [067.4800-078.2600]: Because she knows what I know
Ses01F_script01_2_M009 [078.3800-082.6500]: Hey look
Ses01F_script01_2_F009 [082.1200-091.2800]: Nobody in this house dares take away her faith
Ses01F_script01_2_M010 [090.6500-094.8900]: What do you want me to do? What do you want?
Ses01F_script01_2_F010 [092.3600-102.1700]: I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back
Ses01F_script01_2_F011 [102.2600-105.7600]: I won't stand for any nonsense.
Ses01F_script01_2_M011 [106.6100-108.1825]: Kate.
Ses01F_script01_2_F012 [108.2000-122.3400]: Because if he's not coming back
Ses01F_script01_2_M012 [109.3800-111.6500]: [BREATHING]
Ses01F_script01_2_M013 [121.2900-123.2300]: Calm yourself.
Ses01F_script01_2_F013 [122.4100-132.6200]: Just believe with me
Ses01F_script01_2_M014 [124.1625-126.3600]: Okay. Calm yourself.
Ses01F_script01_2_M015 [126.5800-133.7600]: I know. All right
Ses01F_script01_2_M016 [134.6100-138.0400]: Look at you
Ses01F_script01_2_F014 [137.9800-140.6900]: I can't help it.
Ses01F_script01_2_M017 [140.9200-147.5100]: What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you
Ses01F_script01_2_F000 [006.7800-010.5900]: Why did he invite her here?
Ses01F_script01_2_M000 [010.0840-013.4800]: Why does that bother you?

Ses01F_script01_2_M013 [121.2900-123.2300]: Calm yourself.

Ses01F_script01_2_M017 [140.9200-147.5100]: What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you
Ses01F_script01_3_F000 [004.8285-008.9243]: You're the only one who still loves his parents.
Ses01F_script01_3_M000 [008.5900-013.1700]: I know.  It kind of went out of style
Ses01F_script01_3_F001 [012.3484-017.0473]: It's not so bad; it's a good thing.
Ses01F_script01_3_F002 [017.1566-026.1173]: [BREATHING] You know
Ses01F_script01_3_M001 [026.0445-028.8493]: You're not sorry you came.
Ses01F_script01_3_F003 [028.3100-036.1344]: I'm not sorry
Ses01F_script01_3_M002 [036.1709-038.5386]: Why not?
Ses01F_script01_3_F004 [038.3200-041.6000]: For one thing
Ses01F_script01_3_M003 [041.0000-043.3200]: Well.
Ses01F_script01_3_F005 [042.8200-047.3300]: And then
Ses01F_script01_3_M004 [047.2100-049.5100]: What?
Ses01F_script01_3_F006 [049.1000-053.9831]: Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here.
Ses01F_script01_3_M005 [054.6200-063.9000]: Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so.  They just take it for granted that we're all set.
Ses01F_script01_3_F007 [063.0100-065.8944]: I knew they would.
Ses01F_script01_3_M006 [067.6792-069.8648]: You did?
Ses01F_script01_3_F008 [069.6400-075.9100]: Well sure
Ses01F_script01_3_M007 [078.0800-087.2500]: So would you want to?  I mean
Ses01F_script01_3_F009 [087.6100-094.6700]: I
Ses01F_script01_3_F010 [097.0200-098.4227]: [BREATHING]
Ses01F_script01_3_M008 [098.0700-105.5800]: I love you. Annie
Ses01F_script01_3_F011 [098.9525-101.7250]: [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script01_3_M009 [106.5092-114.9575]: I don't really have any imagination
Ses01F_script01_3_F012 [108.9225-114.0700]: [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script01_3_M010 [115.2878-126.5450]: Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See
Ses01F_script01_3_F013 [117.0000-118.8000]: No. No
Ses01F_script01_3_M011 [126.6800-137.2162]: You feel uncomfortable here
Ses01F_script01_3_F014 [137.2890-142.2065]: Chris
Ses01F_script01_3_M012 [142.9100-147.3790]: And he's gone forever?  Are you sure?
Ses01F_script01_3_F015 [146.9800-150.5845]: I almost got married two years ago.
Ses01F_script01_3_M013 [151.0300-153.5714]: Why didn't you?
Ses01F_script01_3_F016 [153.3875-156.3762]: You started to write me.
Ses01F_script01_3_M014 [156.3033-159.5400]: You felt something that far back?
Ses01F_script01_3_F017 [159.0600-161.2300]: Every day since.
Ses01F_script01_3_M015 [160.7000-163.6600]: Why didn't you let me know?
Ses01F_script01_3_F018 [162.8000-169.6600]: I was waiting for you
Ses01F_script01_3_M016 [171.7200-173.6000]: Give me a...
Ses01F_script01_3_M017 [173.6700-175.7325]: Give me a kiss.
Ses01F_script01_3_M018 [180.2600-186.3491]: God.  I kissed you Annie.
Ses01F_script01_3_F019 [169.6900-172.4600]: beating around the bush.
F:[LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script01_3_F020 [186.2090-193.6800]: I will never forgive you.  All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long
Ses01F_script01_3_M019 [191.1025-196.7400]: Oh Annie
Ses01F_script01_3_F021 [196.1400-198.8950]: Not like that you're not.
Ses01F_script01_3_M020 [199.1000-201.4000]: I kissed you.
Ses01F_script01_3_F022 [200.9200-206.2900]: Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you
Ses01F_script01_3_F023 [212.5813-215.6700]: Chris
Ses01F_script01_3_M021 [216.4800-220.0400]: Hey
Ses01F_script01_3_F024 [218.5400-222.9675]: No. What is it?  Is it your mother?
Ses01F_script01_3_M022 [222.6800-225.5000]: No it's nothing like that. It's-
Ses01F_script01_3_F025 [225.0400-232.9798]: Then what?  Chris.  Even in your letters
Ses01F_script01_3_M023 [232.7248-240.3000]: Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.
Ses01F_script01_3_F026 [240.6200-243.6500]: You've got to tell me.
Ses01F_script01_3_M024 [243.8300-247.5200]: I don't even know how to start.
Ses01F_script01_3_F027 [247.4800-250.6200]: It wouldn't work like this.
Ses01F_script01_3_M025 [251.5000-259.7300]: It's just all mixed up with so many other things
Ses01F_script01_3_F028 [259.1300-261.6600]: Yeah
Ses01F_script01_3_M026 [261.7500-264.9617]: Well I lost them.
Ses01F_script01_3_F029 [266.3100-268.5425]: How many?
Ses01F_script01_3_M027 [268.5600-270.7875]: Pretty much all.
Ses01F_script01_3_F030 [270.6600-273.2600]: Aw
Ses01F_script01_3_M028 [272.4400-283.5024]: You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know?
Ses01F_script01_3_M029 [283.7300-304.5800]: Like for instance
Ses01F_script01_3_M030 [304.7751-319.9900]: They didn't die
Ses01F_script01_3_M031 [320.9000-344.4800]: And I had this idea as I was watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed
Ses01F_script01_3_F031 [344.1800-345.7400]: Mmhmm.
Ses01F_script01_3_M032 [345.9000-359.2200]: To bring that on to the earth again
Ses01F_script01_3_M033 [360.2517-378.3500]: But then I came home and it was incredible
Ses01F_script01_3_M034 [378.4700-383.6500]: Driving my new car and seeing a new refrigerator.
Ses01F_script01_3_M035 [384.5200-400.6480]: I mean...You can't take those things out of a war. when you drive that car and you see that new refrigerator
Ses01F_script01_3_M036 [401.9100-412.5900]: And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.
Ses01F_script01_3_F032 [415.8011-419.8444]: Do you still feel that way?
Ses01F_script01_3_M037 [419.4437-422.5035]: I just want you to know Annie.
Ses01F_script01_3_F033 [422.4670-432.4477]: Because you mustn't feel that way.  Everything you have
Ses01F_script01_3_F034 [432.5570-450.4700]: Even me.  And your money?  Chris
Ses01F_script01_3_M038 [451.0400-460.2800]: Annie
Ses01F_script01_3_F035 [459.5700-463.0600]: What would I do with a fortune?
Ses01F_script02_1_M000 [001.8151-009.0350]: What time is it?  I think it's supposed to run around midnight
Ses01F_script02_1_M001 [009.0925-015.6200]: Actually I want to get a little further up the coast
Ses01F_script02_1_F000 [015.1400-017.2100]: Fine.
Ses01F_script02_1_M002 [016.9600-020.0000]: Okay.  Is that
Ses01F_script02_1_M003 [020.0500-026.6500]: No.  That's just foam.  I don't know.  I can't tell.
Ses01F_script02_1_F001 [025.9100-027.4125]: [BREATHING]
Ses01F_script02_1_M004 [027.1300-035.7987]: I don't know
F: [Mumbles something]
Ses01F_script02_1_M005 [035.8990-039.4800]: Oh no.  you know what I forgot?
Ses01F_script02_1_F002 [038.9900-040.0500]: What?
Ses01F_script02_1_M006 [039.5000-045.4500]: My flashlight.  God
Ses01F_script02_1_F003 [045.0600-047.0300]: What flashlight?
Ses01F_script02_1_M007 [046.4200-049.9500]: The flashlight
Ses01F_script02_1_F004 [049.2200-051.4000]: That's not your flashlight.
Ses01F_script02_1_M008 [050.8500-052.4000]: Whose is it?
Ses01F_script02_1_F005 [051.8700-054.2300]: It's ours; it's my flashlight too.
Ses01F_script02_1_M009 [053.7600-055.4800]: Oh...well. Yeah
Ses01F_script02_1_F006 [054.7200-057.6900]: You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours.
Ses01F_script02_1_M010 [057.2900-058.4200]: No.
Ses01F_script02_1_F007 [057.7500-059.5700]: How's that supposed to make me feel?
Ses01F_script02_1_M011 [058.8800-065.6016]: Of course
Ses01F_script02_1_M012 [065.7270-073.0100]: Naturally.  God
Ses01F_script02_1_M013 [073.1527-077.1400]: Do they always run during a full moon?  I don't remember.  Was it full last year?
Ses01F_script02_1_F008 [076.2700-077.6400]: Yeah.
Ses01F_script02_1_M014 [077.1900-087.6779]: Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know
Ses01F_script02_1_M015 [087.8250-094.5265]: Aw.  Do you know
Ses01F_script02_1_M016 [094.6400-100.4000]: God
M: Uh oh. 
Ses01F_script02_1_F009 [101.7200-103.5025]: [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script02_1_M017 [104.2500-111.2300]: I wonder if they can hear me talk or like feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around.
Ses01F_script02_1_F010 [110.7700-112.6900]: I'm cold.
Ses01F_script02_1_M018 [112.1900-114.3500]: Do you want my jacket?
Ses01F_script02_1_F011 [113.7900-115.9800]: It's after eleven
Ses01F_script02_1_M019 [115.8753-121.9194]: What?  We just got here.  What's the point of coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home?
Ses01F_script02_1_F012 [121.6500-123.2300]: There is no point.
Ses01F_script02_1_M020 [122.7000-124.5900]: Right.
Ses01F_script02_1_F013 [124.0500-126.0400]: That's my point.
Ses01F_script02_1_M021 [125.7500-127.9600]: Wait
Ses01F_script02_1_F014 [127.4400-129.3900]: Well
Ses01F_script02_1_M022 [128.8000-137.7400]: No
Ses01F_script02_1_F015 [137.2900-139.6146]: Not particularly.
Ses01F_script02_1_M023 [139.1100-141.0400]: Why not?
Ses01F_script02_1_F016 [140.5000-143.0700]: I just don't.  It's stupid.
Ses01F_script02_1_M024 [142.7800-155.6400]: Honey
Ses01F_script02_1_F017 [154.9000-163.9900]: Pass what up?  I mean these fish swim out of the ocean
Ses01F_script02_1_M025 [163.1900-176.2823]: Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.
Ses01F_script02_1_M026 [176.3975-181.5500]: This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy.
Ses01F_script02_1_F018 [180.6769-189.4500]: I don't see why you're so excited; this isn't a freaking moon landing we are talking about.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.
Ses01F_script02_1_M027 [188.8800-190.4700]: Yeah they do.
Ses01F_script02_1_F019 [189.9300-191.5900]: Oh Augie
Ses01F_script02_1_M028 [191.1300-201.9700]: okay... well
Ses01F_script02_1_M029 [202.0250-209.4025]: There's like mystery here
Ses01F_script02_1_F020 [208.3800-210.2000]: I'm just not.
Ses01F_script02_1_M030 [209.6300-211.1150]: For real?
Ses01F_script02_1_F021 [210.6400-211.9200]: Yeah.
Ses01F_script02_1_M031 [211.5500-218.5600]: God
Ses01F_script02_1_M032 [218.6125-225.2700]: And last year
Ses01F_script02_1_F022 [224.5800-237.0050]: Last time
Ses01F_script02_1_M033 [236.5000-238.7700]: Ahh...we weren't in a good spot.
Ses01F_script02_1_F023 [238.1400-240.7300]: Hmm.  We didn't see them the year before either.
Ses01F_script02_1_M034 [240.1700-245.7100]: We just weren't in a good spot.  I'm telling you
F: [Mumbles] Oh yeah.
Ses01F_script02_1_M035 [245.7900-253.1140]: Look there
Ses01F_script02_1_M036 [253.1700-261.4425]: God
Ses01F_script02_1_M037 [261.5675-276.6283]: Right now out there
Ses01F_script02_1_M038 [276.7775-291.4000]: Just all at once
Ses01F_script02_1_M039 [291.4700-298.1386]: They are swimming right now.  They are swimming as if that is the only thing that matters to them.
Ses01F_script02_1_M040 [298.2452-305.6600]: It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge.
Ses01F_script02_1_M041 [305.9850-316.0900]: And they are swimming right now to this very point where we stand for this huge celebration of sex and death.
Ses01F_script02_1_M042 [316.1527-321.7375]: Oh look.  I'm giving myself goose bumps
Ses01F_script02_1_F024 [321.2100-323.8200]: That's the wind.
Ses01F_script02_1_M043 [324.1500-327.0891]: So what do you think?
Ses01F_script02_1_F025 [326.5600-329.0300]: About what?
Ses01F_script02_1_M044 [328.2400-331.9283]: About all of that
Ses01F_script02_2_M000 [003.1700-006.2675]: Look at this
Ses01F_script02_2_F000 [005.8300-008.3081]: That's the wind.
Ses01F_script02_2_M001 [007.7800-010.2200]: Well
Ses01F_script02_2_F001 [009.5800-011.4525]: About what?
Ses01F_script02_2_M002 [010.9900-013.4131]: About what I was saying.
Ses01F_script02_2_F002 [013.2797-017.0500]: I think it's ridiculous.
Ses01F_script02_2_M003 [016.4100-022.2600]: It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
Ses01F_script02_2_F003 [021.8300-029.7100]: It's PR! Somebody sold you a bunch of crap that there is this wonderful thing that is going to happen tonight on the beach.
Ses01F_script02_2_M004 [028.9400-031.6600]: Not just me
Ses01F_script02_2_F004 [031.2100-043.4739]: Everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us coming back for more
Ses01F_script02_2_M005 [042.7835-045.9825]: Are we talking about the same thing
Ses01F_script02_2_F005 [045.4200-049.0894]: I'm sorry
Ses01F_script02_2_M006 [049.2000-056.0900]: Carla
Ses01F_script02_2_F006 [055.6700-061.9600]: Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that
Ses01F_script02_2_M007 [061.2800-063.5700]: Well then
Ses01F_script02_2_F007 [063.1500-068.8600]: We just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to look like.
Ses01F_script02_2_M008 [068.3400-077.8800]: There is nothing to it; we come down here
Ses01F_script02_2_F008 [075.6600-081.6545]: For God- Grow up
Ses01F_script02_2_M009 [081.1500-082.7975]: Why not?
Ses01F_script02_2_F009 [082.3400-086.5400]: Because they never do.  Have they...Have they ever?
Ses01F_script02_2_M010 [086.1500-088.4300]: We've missed them twice.
Ses01F_script02_2_F010 [087.7100-091.3205]: Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever.
Ses01F_script02_2_M011 [091.5046-094.8877]: They'll show up this time.
Ses01F_script02_2_F011 [094.5325-098.8125]: No they won't.  It's like waiting for Santa Claus.
Ses01F_script02_2_F012 [098.8450-111.6500]: I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on this beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish never show up.
Ses01F_script02_2_M012 [110.8500-113.9400]: I thought you wanted to see it.
Ses01F_script02_2_F013 [113.3900-115.7800]: You don't understand anything I am saying.
Ses01F_script02_2_M013 [115.0300-117.2346]: No. Of course not.
Ses01F_script02_2_F014 [116.9814-124.0468]: I did want to see it
Ses01F_script02_2_F015 [124.0928-134.5900]: I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting.  I feel like this night is going to be the night
Ses01F_script02_2_M014 [133.6600-136.7425]: It's just fish
Ses01F_script02_2_F016 [136.1600-139.3300]: For God's sake
Ses01F_script02_2_M015 [138.6200-144.1450]: Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards and pinpoint the exact moment where we took a turn for the worst here.
Ses01F_script02_2_M016 [144.1650-159.8000]: Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight
Ses01F_script02_2_M017 [159.8775-165.3700]: Okay.  So I am putting out the pets
Ses01F_script02_2_F017 [165.7200-172.6700]: Do you remember the first year we came here?  It was like four years after we got married.
Ses01F_script02_2_F018 [173.9200-187.6100]: We thought I was pregnant
Ses01F_script02_2_F019 [187.8883-204.1594]: You whispered the sweetest
Ses01F_script02_2_M018 [203.5900-206.9211]: Wait a minute
Ses01F_script02_2_F020 [206.4200-209.2600]: Drinking champagne from the bottle
Ses01F_script02_2_M019 [211.3400-221.8950]: It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker
Ses01F_script02_2_F021 [209.2900-211.9500]: dancing barefoot in the sand.
Ses01F_script02_2_M020 [221.9724-227.6800]: That's what it is?  Right?  You want this to be like the other time
Ses01F_script02_2_F022 [227.2196-233.5946]: I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.
Ses01F_script02_2_M021 [232.8800-237.9673]: Sure.  All right.  Okay.
Ses01F_script02_2_M022 [238.0133-243.3756]: Listen
Ses01F_script02_2_F023 [243.1455-245.4699]: No.
Ses01F_script02_2_M023 [244.9200-247.8800]: Do you want me to go get some champagne?
Ses01F_script02_2_F024 [247.4089-249.0832]: No.
Ses01F_script02_2_M024 [249.0900-250.9200]: Do you want to take off your shoes?
Ses01F_script02_2_F025 [250.1400-253.9225]: No
Ses01F_script02_2_M025 [251.8900-253.4098]: Then what?
Ses01F_script02_2_M026 [256.8300-260.8204]: Do you want to get married again?
Ses01F_script02_2_F026 [260.2214-262.0632]: No.
Ses01F_script02_2_M027 [261.7500-266.7811]: What?  What?  Do you want a divorce?
Ses01F_script02_2_M028 [267.0343-269.5888]: A vacation?
Ses01F_script02_2_F027 [269.5575-271.5911]: No.
Ses01F_script02_2_M029 [270.9007-279.6400]: Like a new carpet?  A poodle?  A back rub?  Ice cream?  A suicide pact?  What do you want?  What the hell do you want?
Ses01F_script02_2_F028 [278.7400-282.9200]: I just want something to turn out like I expected it to.
Ses01F_script02_2_M030 [282.0800-294.3000]: Well welcome to the human race
Ses01F_script02_2_F029 [291.9425-293.3800]: [BREATHING]
Ses01F_script02_2_M031 [294.3300-309.0300]: No I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all roses and peaches and the bills would just pay themselves.  And we'll have three
Ses01F_script02_2_M032 [309.0850-311.7279]: Do you know what you get?  You get this.
Ses01F_script02_2_F030 [311.4518-317.1300]: This? What is this?  This is nothing.  This isn't even anything.
Ses01F_script02_2_M033 [316.8500-319.8750]: Yes it is.
Ses01F_script02_2_F031 [319.4461-324.9325]: Sure.  This is standing on the beach waiting.  This is fighting.
Ses01F_script02_2_M034 [324.4100-326.3400]: Right
Ses01F_script02_2_F032 [327.9760-334.5600]: I mean this is a lot of things
Ses01F_script02_2_M035 [331.6100-335.1425]: [BREATHING]
Ses01F_script02_2_F033 [334.7500-337.8491]: Do you understand what I am saying?
Ses01F_script02_2_M036 [337.3198-339.8275]: I'm doing the best I can.
Ses01F_script02_2_F034 [339.3400-343.8100]: I know you are Augie
Ses01F_script02_2_F035 [352.6600-366.2026]: I know you meant this to be special
Ses01F_script02_2_M037 [366.2026-369.0947]: Maybe if you were with someone else
Ses01F_script02_2_F036 [368.6300-370.8000]: I didn't say that.
Ses01F_script02_2_M038 [373.5100-377.1344]: I just- I know I don't make you happy.
Ses01F_script02_2_F037 [376.6511-384.0300]: Don't be ridiculous.  Anything that- anything I am doing
Ses01F_script02_2_M039 [384.0157-385.6925]: Yeah?
Ses01F_script02_2_F038 [385.3000-388.7500]: Yeah.  Don't you know that?
Ses01F_script02_2_F039 [389.7462-393.4700]: For Heaven's sake Augie.
Ses01F_script02_2_F040 [394.9704-404.9600]: You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else.  Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously
Ses01F_script02_2_M040 [406.0100-412.7900]: You know
Ses01F_script02_2_F041 [413.7500-419.3655]: So maybe we are in the wrong spot
Ses01F_script02_2_M041 [419.3800-423.7152]: I don't know
Ses01F_script02_2_M042 [425.4413-429.7000]: We have a great view of the moon from here
Ses01F_script02_2_F042 [428.8300-435.0600]: Hmm.  I noticed that
Ses01F_script02_2_M043 [434.6255-436.0279]: [BREATHING]
Ses01F_script02_2_M044 [436.3040-439.4800]: And look what I got here.
Ses01F_script02_2_F043 [438.9800-442.8150]: Augie
Ses01F_script02_2_M045 [442.3600-444.5600]: It's not champagne.
Ses01F_script02_2_F044 [444.2349-446.3700]: I guess we don't need glasses.
Ses01F_script02_2_M046 [445.9900-447.8802]: [BREATHING]
Ses01F_script02_2_M047 [449.3991-453.6338]: Do you want to go home?  Are you cold?
Ses01F_script02_2_F045 [455.5669-460.1600]: I'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all.
Ses01F_script02_2_F046 [463.6525-466.1765]: Augie
Ses01F_script02_2_M048 [465.4700-472.4700]: Shh.  If we're very quiet
Ses01F_script02_2_F047 [473.6101-476.5559]: Or not.
Ses01F_script02_2_M049 [476.6710-479.1565]: Or not.
Ses01F_script03_1_M000 [004.2888-006.1800]: Good God.
Ses01F_script03_1_F000 [005.5300-007.7000]: Is it them?
Ses01F_script03_1_M001 [007.2900-009.1800]: I wonder.
Ses01F_script03_1_F001 [008.7400-015.2000]: Freda is the only one who knows we are here.  She wouldn't ring up.
Ses01F_script03_1_M002 [014.6400-017.4300]: It must be them then.
Ses01F_script03_1_F002 [017.2000-022.7100]: It had to happen sooner or later.  What are we going to do?
Ses01F_script03_1_M003 [019.8475-021.2900]: [BREATHING]
Ses01F_script03_1_M004 [022.1600-024.9500]: We are okay
Ses01F_script03_1_F003 [024.4700-027.4400]: Now and always
Ses01F_script03_1_M005 [026.8600-029.5200]: I don't care then.
Ses01F_script03_1_F004 [028.9600-032.9400]: It had to happen sooner or later.
Ses01F_script03_1_M006 [033.9200-039.3100]: Hello?  Hello?  I'm sorry
Ses01F_script03_1_M007 [039.5000-045.7750]: No.  Wrong number. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script03_1_F005 [041.1700-047.6400]: [LAUGHTER] That sent shivers up my spine.
Ses01F_script03_1_M008 [046.7200-051.9842]: What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.[LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script03_1_F006 [051.2835-053.8175]: We'll behave exquisitely.
Ses01F_script03_1_M009 [053.2800-055.3300]: With perfect poise.
Ses01F_script03_1_F007 [054.6100-056.8000]: I think I shall do a curtsy.
Ses01F_script03_1_M010 [056.3700-064.4300]: It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully
Ses01F_script03_1_F008 [063.4100-067.4075]: Hmm.  The pity is that one can't stay happy.
Ses01F_script03_1_M011 [066.8400-069.2900]: Darling
Ses01F_script03_1_F009 [068.7000-071.8100]: It's true.  I think the whole thing's a cruel joke.
Ses01F_script03_1_M012 [071.0000-075.4300]: What?  This beautiful and sacred thing - love?
Ses01F_script03_1_F010 [074.6500-077.1800]: Yes.  Meaning just that.
Ses01F_script03_1_M013 [076.3200-086.5180]: Well what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God
Ses01F_script03_1_F011 [084.4700-088.2600]: Don't laugh at me.  I'm being serious.
Ses01F_script03_1_M014 [087.7600-092.5700]: Oh darling
Ses01F_script03_1_F012 [092.1400-093.6600]: Who's they?
Ses01F_script03_1_M015 [093.2300-100.1600]: All of those futile moralists who make life unbearable.  You have to laugh at them
Ses01F_script03_1_M016 [100.1950-106.5500]: You know
Ses01F_script03_1_F013 [105.9400-109.3900]: you know if I laugh at everything then I must laugh at us
Ses01F_script03_1_M017 [108.8700-113.0200]: Oh of course.  We are figures of fun.  All right.
Ses01F_script03_1_F014 [112.4000-118.3800]: How long with it last
Ses01F_script03_1_M018 [118.0823-120.5300]: Who knows?
Ses01F_script03_1_F015 [120.0800-122.4300]: Shall we always want to bicker and fight?
Ses01F_script03_1_M019 [121.9500-127.1500]: Oh no.  That fire will fade along with our passion.
Ses01F_script03_1_F016 [126.1000-128.9675]: Oh dear
Ses01F_script03_1_M020 [128.3800-131.7700]: Well it depends on how well we've played.
Ses01F_script03_1_F017 [131.8800-136.8000]: What happens if one of us dies?  Does the other one still laugh?
Ses01F_script03_1_M021 [136.5000-140.4925]: Yes.  Yes with all of his might.
Ses01F_script03_1_F018 [139.9400-142.6900]: Well that's serious enough
Ses01F_script03_1_M022 [142.2400-150.9200]: No
Ses01F_script03_1_F019 [149.9500-153.0800]: I think you are talking nonsense.
Ses01F_script03_1_M023 [152.1300-155.0425]: Oh.  So is everyone
Ses01F_script03_1_M024 [155.1150-167.7000]: Let's be superficial
Ses01F_script03_1_F020 [165.1525-169.7325]: [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script03_1_M025 [168.6900-176.2700]: Oh Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.
Ses01F_script03_1_F021 [174.8825-178.8500]: Oh Elliott
Ses01F_script03_1_M026 [178.9700-195.6000]: Oh See
Ses01F_script03_1_F022 [194.8500-204.0100]: Aw.  Thank you
Ses01F_script03_1_M027 [204.5900-210.7575]: Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
Ses01F_script03_1_F023 [208.8925-211.4200]: Which particular one?
Ses01F_script03_1_M028 [211.0300-215.8300]: The one where you put that tiny painted wooden snake in my bed.
Ses01F_script03_1_F024 [215.2800-220.3500]: Oh Charles
Ses01F_script03_1_M029 [216.6325-218.5225]: [GARBAGE]
Ses01F_script03_1_M030 [219.2200-221.8200]: It was a terrible thing.  I hated it.
Ses01F_script03_1_F025 [221.1200-226.8700]: I know you did.  You threw him out the window into the Grand Canal.  I'll never forgive you for that.
Ses01F_script03_1_M031 [226.3200-228.8900]: How long did that row last?
Ses01F_script03_1_F026 [228.3700-231.0700]: It went on intermittently for days.
Ses01F_script03_1_M032 [230.3700-231.9050]: Uh huh.
Ses01F_script03_1_M033 [232.1675-238.4900]: But the worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.
Ses01F_script03_1_F027 [237.4000-242.2600]: Oh And it burnt my comb
Ses01F_script03_1_M034 [241.6000-245.8700]: That was a rouser
Ses01F_script03_1_F028 [244.0875-248.0700]: [LAUGHTER] That was the first time you hit me.
Ses01F_script03_1_M035 [247.7400-250.7000]: I did not hit you very hard.
Ses01F_script03_1_F029 [250.2200-262.4300]: The manager came in
Ses01F_script03_1_M036 [256.8500-262.0325]: [LAUGHTER] I'll never forget his face. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script03_1_M037 [262.3975-267.4500]: [LAUGHTER] We were very much younger then.
Ses01F_script03_1_F030 [262.4600-269.6400]: [LAUGHTER] And very much sillier.
Ses01F_script03_1_M038 [271.6400-276.2000]: However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses01F_script03_1_F031 [275.9100-279.9900]: Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.
Ses01F_script03_2_M000 [003.1785-006.2400]: We were very much younger then.
Ses01F_script03_2_F000 [004.8100-010.0600]: And very much sillier.
Ses01F_script03_2_M001 [009.5600-016.0125]: However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses01F_script03_2_F001 [015.4800-019.5500]: Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.
Ses01F_script03_2_M002 [018.6600-023.0400]: I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
Ses01F_script03_2_F002 [022.3100-026.1300]: Presents?  It was only a trivial
Ses01F_script03_2_M003 [025.7100-029.8700]: It was bristling with diamonds.  In the worst possible taste
Ses01F_script03_2_F003 [029.2200-034.5800]: It was not.  I still have it
Ses01F_script03_2_M004 [034.2100-038.4400]: You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses01F_script03_2_F004 [037.5000-043.1500]: I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination.
Ses01F_script03_2_M005 [042.2500-047.1200]: Well
Ses01F_script03_2_F005 [046.7500-048.7825]: Well
Ses01F_script03_2_M006 [048.1600-049.9500]: What of it?
Ses01F_script03_2_F006 [049.4100-053.4700]: It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.
Ses01F_script03_2_M007 [052.6700-055.2693]: What about me?
Ses01F_script03_2_F007 [054.7489-061.4654]: If you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey
Ses01F_script03_2_M008 [060.8262-064.8857]: That's a nice point of view
Ses01F_script03_2_F008 [064.3325-067.5625]: Oh dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.
Ses01F_script03_2_M009 [067.0600-074.0100]: So am I.  I'm bored stiff. [GARBAGE]  Do you want some brandy?
Ses01F_script03_2_F009 [073.6900-076.1625]: No.  Thank you.
Ses01F_script03_2_M010 [075.9600-078.6500]: I'll have a little
Ses01F_script03_2_F010 [078.2197-081.8200]: I don't know why you'd want any
Ses01F_script03_2_M011 [081.3800-084.9165]: No particular reason.  Anyhow
Ses01F_script03_2_F011 [084.4600-088.9700]: I just think it's silly to go on and on and on about such a thing.
Ses01F_script03_2_M012 [088.0800-094.2300]: You can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long
Ses01F_script03_2_F012 [093.8500-096.9300]: It's become a habit with you.
Ses01F_script03_2_M013 [095.9900-100.9500]: Oh.  Don't be so grand.  Just because you don't happen to want one at the moment.
Ses01F_script03_2_F013 [100.2315-102.3100]: Don't be stupid.
Ses01F_script03_2_M014 [101.9000-104.1500]: Really
Ses01F_script03_2_F014 [103.2700-105.4500]: What?
Ses01F_script03_2_M015 [105.2596-108.2337]: Nothing.
Ses01F_script03_2_M016 [111.9800-115.3300]: you going out somewhere
Ses01F_script03_2_F015 [114.8512-119.6000]: No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you.
Ses01F_script03_2_M017 [119.7000-122.8900]: That reply has broken my heart.
Ses01F_script03_2_F016 [121.9500-126.5400]: Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man.
Ses01F_script03_2_M018 [126.1529-129.1350]: Well as a matter of fact
Ses01F_script03_2_F017 [128.7100-130.4800]: No it isn't.
Ses01F_script03_2_M019 [130.0500-131.4200]: Yes it is.
Ses01F_script03_2_F018 [130.9500-132.7900]: You shut up.
Ses01F_script03_2_M020 [132.3100-137.4000]: Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy
Ses01F_script03_2_F019 [137.1300-141.1970]: It's funny it hasn't worked such wonders for you.
Ses01F_script03_2_M021 [140.8379-144.0300]: Snap
Ses01F_script03_2_F020 [143.6400-146.3800]: Adders don't snap
Ses01F_script03_2_M022 [145.6700-152.9500]: Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap.
Ses01F_script03_2_F021 [149.9800-158.4966]: They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops.
Ses01F_script03_2_M023 [157.8200-161.5400]: Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
Ses01F_script03_2_F022 [160.7500-163.3800]: Yes I did
Ses01F_script03_2_M024 [162.7700-175.5200]: And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than
Ses01F_script03_2_F023 [165.6900-167.9300]: Mind your own business.
Ses01F_script03_2_F024 [175.1100-179.4600]: You're quite insufferable
Ses01F_script03_2_M025 [178.7700-183.2600]: I think I am not in the least bit drunk.
Ses01F_script03_2_F025 [182.0300-184.9100]: You've always had a weak head.
Ses01F_script03_2_M026 [184.3500-193.4894]: I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that.
Ses01F_script03_2_F026 [193.0300-198.8800]: On the contrary
Ses01F_script03_2_M027 [197.9100-212.7500]: That's very interesting Amanda. How about a child of four?  Or a child of six?  Or a child of nine? We can get a good little conversation going on about this
Ses01F_script03_2_F027 [201.3300-203.3069]: Oh shut up.
Ses01F_script03_2_F028 [205.3300-207.8000]: Shut up.
Ses01F_script03_2_F029 [212.4025-215.4525]: Not very funny
Ses01F_script03_2_M028 [215.1200-221.1500]: [LAUGHTER] That's a very good idea.  I think I will.
Ses01F_script03_2_M029 [224.5224-229.6000]: Look
Ses01F_script03_2_F030 [227.0225-228.4100]: Why?
Ses01F_script03_2_F031 [229.4275-233.0800]: There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.
Ses01F_script03_2_M030 [233.4050-235.7308]: Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs.
Ses01F_script03_2_F032 [235.2400-237.8068]: They are away in Tunis.
Ses01F_script03_2_M031 [237.2400-241.4997]: This is no time of year for Tunis.
Ses01F_script03_2_F033 [241.2519-244.1269]: Turn it on again
Ses01F_script03_2_M032 [243.8542-246.8036]: I will do no such thing.
Ses01F_script03_2_F034 [246.5557-251.6118]: Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
Ses01F_script03_2_M033 [251.3391-257.0100]: Will you turn that off
Ses01F_script03_2_F035 [256.4800-260.4175]: You are far too temperamental
Ses01F_script03_2_M034 [260.4625-263.6400]: Turn it off.
Ses01F_script03_2_F036 [262.8900-271.7200]: I won't.  Let go
Ses01F_script03_2_M035 [264.8475-267.1900]: Amanda
Ses01F_script03_2_M036 [269.3425-273.6100]: Oh.  That's very amusing indeed.
Ses01F_script03_2_F037 [272.7300-283.0800]: Oh shut up.  Let go.  I hate you
Ses01F_script03_2_M037 [277.5875-286.5600]: You are a vile
Ses01F_script03_2_F038 [287.2950-292.7200]: This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever.
Ses01F_script03_2_M038 [293.2325-295.3000]: You're not going like this.
Ses01F_script03_2_F039 [294.6300-296.6200]: Oh.  Yes I am.
Ses01F_script03_2_M039 [295.9600-297.4550]: You're not.
Ses01F_script03_2_F040 [297.0300-315.4600]: Yes I am.   Stop it. Stop it.  Let go of me. Oh.  You're a cruel fiend.  I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again?  Never
Ses01F_script03_2_M040 [298.6500-314.6500]: Shut up. Shut up. God
Ses01M_impro01_F000 [006.7700-008.4600]: Next.
Ses01M_impro01_M000 [008.2208-011.2800]: Yes
Ses01M_impro01_F001 [008.5500-010.6000]: My window is open.
Ses01M_impro01_M001 [011.3200-013.7700]: Okay
Ses01M_impro01_F002 [014.4600-018.2300]: This is... Your last- Your first name is Jones?
Ses01M_impro01_M002 [013.7700-016.8800]: and I have This form of ID here so...

Ses01M_impro07_F019 [116.5000-119.0250]: I'm surprised you don't know that.
Ses01M_impro07_F020 [121.1500-125.2500]: Oh. That is incredible. Is it--
Ses01M_impro07_F021 [125.3100-132.5725]: do they have a--is it a co-ed softball team?  I mean... Really? You know
Ses01M_impro07_M016 [127.5200-131.3900]: No it's all boys. All boys' softball team.
Ses01M_impro07_M017 [131.9500-134.6200]: They do it's--believe me it's huge.
Ses01M_impro07_F022 [132.8600-138.1200]: Who do you play? Like do--are you like... nationally ranked?
Ses01M_impro07_M018 [135.3050-141.0100]: I just got into it. I just kind of fell into it. Literally I was walking around and...
Ses01M_impro07_F023 [139.0700-141.8000]: That is unbelievable.
Ses01M_impro07_M019 [141.3400-142.6800]: It's pretty wild.
Ses01M_impro07_F024 [141.9900-144.4850]: I would put that right up there with--ping-pong.
Ses01M_impro07_M020 [143.9800-147.8400]: Yeah
Ses01M_impro07_F025 [144.6600-148.2650]: I mean not to denigrate what you are doing.  I think that's great.
Ses01M_impro07_M021 [147.9100-150.1225]: Oh you mean it's not really sport that what you're saying?
Ses01M_impro07_F026 [149.7100-154.9200]: No
Ses01M_impro07_M022 [150.7925-153.8000]: It's totally a sport. What are you talking about?
Ses01M_impro07_M023 [153.8600-159.1400]: What
Ses01M_impro07_F027 [156.1800-167.8000]: I am not saying you should be. I'm not no. I think it's great I think you should be incredibly proud yourself especially because you're going to U.S.C for free for doing it. For free.
Ses01M_impro07_M024 [165.1825-169.6425]: For free that's really what it's about. I mean who cares I mean if I have to play softball all the time?
Ses01M_impro07_M025 [169.7275-172.3400]: But they got to like drive around in a bus--that would suck.
Ses01M_impro07_F028 [171.7300-174.2000]: Oh really? With the whole team?
Ses01M_impro07_M026 [172.4600-175.3625]: Yeah we have like away games and stuff.
Ses01M_impro07_F029 [174.9300-180.9100]: What are your teammates like? I'm sure you don't know yet? What kind of people play softball?
Ses01M_impro07_M027 [177.2600-178.7500]: They're nice.
Ses01M_impro07_M028 [179.9400-185.3475]: Like
Ses01M_impro07_F030 [183.0200-184.7200]: Oh really?
Ses01M_impro07_F031 [185.4225-188.8425]: Cool. You don't seem like you'd fit in there.
Ses01M_impro07_M029 [185.7800-191.5200]: That kind of...They're okay.  No I'm like- I'm kind of like the odd man out I'm like...
Ses01M_impro07_F032 [191.0500-192.2475]: Oh
Ses01M_impro07_M030 [192.2200-194.2500]: But you know I'm like [GARBAGE].
Ses01M_impro07_F033 [192.7000-195.0500]: You're like the rookie? The new kid.
Ses01M_impro07_M031 [194.7700-196.0200]: Yeah.
Ses01M_impro07_F034 [195.1700-205.4775]: Just watch in five years you'll be like on the force. You carry around donuts in your back pocket... [LAUGHTER]
Ses01M_impro07_M032 [196.3800-199.8600]: I'm going to have a mustache...On the force...
Ses01M_impro07_M033 [204.8100-206.6000]: Pull over..
Ses01M_script01_1_F000 [008.0600-011.5914]: What he's going to say?
Ses01M_script01_1_M000 [011.4962-014.8175]: He saw it.
Ses01M_script01_1_F001 [014.4000-016.6181]: When?
Ses01M_script01_1_M001 [016.2300-019.5441]: He was out here at four this morning.
Ses01M_script01_1_F002 [019.2815-023.9200]: How could he see it?  I was the first one up and he was still in bed.
Ses01M_script01_1_M002 [023.6500-029.7850]: I was out here at four this morning I heard a crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right over there.
Ses01M_script01_1_F003 [029.3349-033.2000]: What was he doing here at four in the morning?
Ses01M_script01_1_M003 [032.9700-039.3100]: I don't know.  But he went back in the kitchen and he cried.
Ses01M_script01_1_F004 [039.7634-042.1267]: Did you talk to him?
Ses01M_script01_1_M004 [041.6100-046.5800]: No.  I figured I'd just let it wait.
Ses01M_script01_1_F005 [047.3034-050.4170]: Cried hard?
Ses01M_script01_1_M005 [050.5400-055.6600]: Yeah
Ses01M_script01_1_F006 [056.6816-058.8948]: [BREATHING]
Ses01M_script01_1_F007 [059.1300-062.7211]: What is he doing out here at that hour?
Ses01M_script01_1_M006 [062.8336-064.8400]: I don't know.
Ses01M_script01_1_F008 [064.2400-069.2483]: He's dreaming about him again
Ses01M_script01_1_M007 [069.4734-072.3994]: I guess he is.
Ses01M_script01_1_F009 [072.3725-077.4625]: It's getting to be just like after he died.  What is the meaning of that?
Ses01M_script01_1_M008 [076.7000-082.3525]: I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know we've made terrible mistake with father.
Ses01M_script01_1_F010 [081.8100-084.0400]: What?
Ses01M_script01_1_M009 [084.2534-092.2060]: I mean
Ses01M_script01_1_F011 [091.9059-095.3200]: What do you mean a mistake?
Ses01M_script01_1_M010 [095.9573-106.3450]: I just--why shouldn't he walk the nights waiting for him
Ses01M_script01_1_F012 [105.8606-108.8100]: What do you want to do
Ses01M_script01_1_M011 [107.9600-118.7275]: I don't want to argue with him
Ses01M_script01_1_F013 [118.3898-120.8400]: You can't say that to him.
Ses01M_script01_1_M012 [120.3100-122.6200]: I got to.
Ses01M_script01_1_F014 [122.4600-128.7433]: What
Ses01M_script01_1_M013 [128.2182-135.4200]: For God's sake
Ses01M_script01_1_F015 [134.6600-145.9650]: To you it is
Ses01M_script01_1_M014 [145.3600-151.1800]: Okay
Ses01M_script01_1_F016 [149.0800-155.9500]: The trouble is those god damn news papers.  Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so--
Ses01M_script01_1_M015 [154.6500-165.3300]: Yeah
Ses01M_script01_1_F017 [166.3800-168.4175]: Why?
Ses01M_script01_1_M016 [168.6450-170.3700]: You know.
Ses01M_script01_1_F018 [170.0400-174.8088]: Well
Ses01M_script01_1_M017 [175.6100-179.2900]: I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses01M_script01_1_F019 [179.6100-183.7800]: Well
Ses01M_script01_1_M018 [183.1900-185.7400]: You know it's not just my business.
Ses01M_script01_1_F020 [185.1200-188.7900]: Well
Ses01M_script01_1_M019 [187.8000-190.5600]: So it's okay then?  I'm just going to go ahead with it?
Ses01M_script01_1_F021 [189.8700-192.8600]: You want to make sure that your father's not going to...
Ses01M_script01_1_M020 [192.2400-204.6689]: See.  Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me
Ses01M_script01_1_F022 [194.2750-196.5900]: I'm just saying.
Ses01M_script01_1_F023 [204.2938-212.0300]: I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl.
Ses01M_script01_1_M021 [210.7800-213.8300]: She is not Larry's girl.
Ses01M_script01_1_F024 [213.1000-226.1500]: From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.  I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go.  See
Ses01M_script01_1_M022 [234.2400-241.2200]: I don't know why it is you know every time I reach out for something I have to pull back 'cause I'm afraid it's going to hurt somebody.  All my life...
Ses01M_script01_1_F025 [240.5600-244.1900]: You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.
Ses01M_script01_1_M023 [243.5500-245.9000]: To hell with that.
Ses01M_script01_1_F026 [247.1332-251.1095]: Did you ask Annie yet?
Ses01M_script01_1_M024 [250.7344-254.3490]: No
Ses01M_script01_1_F027 [253.5400-258.8275]: Well
Ses01M_script01_1_M025 [258.2900-267.6200]: Well
Ses01M_script01_1_F028 [268.7405-274.2300]: The trouble is you don't see enough women
Ses01M_script01_1_M026 [273.3900-277.8500]: So what?  I'm just--I'm not fast with women.
Ses01M_script01_1_F029 [278.1000-281.2100]: I don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses01M_script01_1_M027 [280.3900-282.4625]: Because it is.
Ses01M_script01_1_F030 [281.5900-289.5300]: That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war
Ses01M_script01_1_M028 [288.4200-295.5900]: I don't know
Ses01M_script01_1_F031 [299.1800-308.3500]: He thinks he's coming back
Ses01M_script01_1_F032 [308.4800-315.0500]: Do you know what that'll do to you
Ses01M_script01_1_M029 [319.9500-321.9700]: All right then.
Ses01M_script01_1_F033 [321.4200-323.4650]: Give it some more thought.
Ses01M_script01_1_M030 [322.8200-329.9700]: I've given it lots of thought.  And I keep coming back to the same thing.
Ses01M_script01_1_M031 [334.5001-346.8900]: When I think of a family
Ses01M_script01_1_F034 [346.5500-349.1200]: What the hell is this?
Ses01M_script01_1_M032 [348.5200-353.4525]: I'll leave.  I'll get married and move somewhere else maybe New York.
Ses01M_script01_1_F035 [352.8800-356.2574]: Are you crazy?
Ses01M_script01_1_M033 [356.5200-359.2584]: I'll do it.
Ses01M_script01_1_F036 [359.0800-364.8550]: You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this?
Ses01M_script01_1_M034 [364.2500-368.5500]: Business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses01M_script01_1_F037 [367.5400-370.9500]: Oh
Ses01M_script01_1_M035 [369.3000-380.4900]: Yes
Ses01M_script01_1_M036 [380.6425-383.3415]: If that can't happen here...
Ses01M_script01_1_F038 [384.2043-389.9700]: You mean to tell me you would leave the business for this.
Ses01M_script01_1_M037 [389.2000-392.1500]: Yes
Ses01M_script01_1_F039 [391.9425-394.8650]: Well
Ses01M_script01_1_M038 [394.4000-397.0800]: Then help me stay here mom.
Ses01M_script01_1_F040 [397.1175-408.9800]: All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for.  This is all for you
Ses01M_script01_1_M039 [405.1800-407.5100]: I know
Ses01M_script01_1_M040 [408.0000-410.1525]: Then help me stay.
Ses01M_script01_1_F041 [410.0300-412.8900]: Well
Ses01M_script01_1_M041 [412.1300-414.7800]: I am thinking like that.
Ses01M_script01_1_F042 [415.0800-418.9410]: I don't understand you
Ses01M_script01_1_M042 [418.6034-423.2925]: No
Ses01M_script01_1_F043 [422.8798-426.0309]: Well
Ses01M_script01_2_F000 [005.3913-008.2350]: Why did he invite her here?
Ses01M_script01_2_M000 [008.4194-012.9200]: Well
Ses01M_script01_2_F001 [012.7400-017.2800]: It's been three and a half years.  Why all of a sudden?
Ses01M_script01_2_M001 [018.1900-025.3600]: Well uh
Ses01M_script01_2_M002 [026.5500-032.1900]: Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything he told you.
Ses01M_script01_2_F002 [032.6300-035.3425]: He's not going to marry her.
Ses01M_script01_2_M003 [034.7100-037.2100]: How do you know he's even thinking about it?
Ses01M_script01_2_F003 [036.7600-039.4800]: it's got that about it.
Ses01M_script01_2_M004 [039.1700-041.6900]: Oh so what?
Ses01M_script01_2_F004 [041.1800-044.7000]: What is going on here
Ses01M_script01_2_M005 [044.6700-048.3700]: Okay
Ses01M_script01_2_F005 [047.6200-056.0600]: The girl is not Larry's.  If the girl is Larry's girl she's not his she know she's not.
Ses01M_script01_2_M006 [063.5200-065.2800]: Listen. Line. You can't read her mind.
Ses01M_script01_2_F006 [064.4200-072.3600]: Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men probably a hundred people told her she is crazy but she is waited.
Ses01M_script01_2_M007 [071.8800-074.4000]: And how do you know why she's waited.
Ses01M_script01_2_F007 [074.0100-086.7700]: Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock. in my darkest moments I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.
Ses01M_script01_2_M008 [087.5300-093.4400]: Okay
Ses01M_script01_2_F008 [092.8300-103.0000]: Nobody in this house dares take away her faith Joe.  Her- strangers might but not her father
Ses01M_script01_2_M009 [102.6100-106.8600]: What do you want me to do?  What do you want?
Ses01M_script01_2_F009 [104.7050-118.3200]: I want you to---act like he is coming back.  Don't think I haven't noticed you
Ses01M_script01_2_M010 [119.2100-121.2425]: Kate...
Ses01M_script01_2_F010 [120.9400-124.3900]: Because if he's not coming back then I'll kill myself.
Ses01M_script01_2_M011 [124.2883-125.3375]: [BREATHING]
Ses01M_script01_2_F011 [124.9800-135.2991]: Oh
Ses01M_script01_2_M012 [134.6900-137.0700]: All right
Ses01M_script01_2_F012 [136.6100-145.6000]: Believe with me Joe
Ses01M_script01_2_M013 [138.5700-142.3975]: Okay
Ses01M_script01_2_M014 [144.4400-146.7900]: calm yourself.
Ses01M_script01_2_F013 [145.6400-150.2900]: You above all have got to believe. Just don't stop believing.
Ses01M_script01_2_M015 [147.5375-152.1200]: What does that mean? Me above all? What does that mean?
Ses01M_script01_2_M016 [152.6600-157.8900]: Look at you. You're shaking.
Ses01M_script01_2_F014 [159.3000-161.8600]: I can't help it.
Ses01M_script01_2_M017 [163.3800-167.4300]: What the hell do you want from me
Ses01M_script01_3_F000 [008.2904-011.9425]: The only one I know still love his parents.
Ses01M_script01_3_M000 [011.8600-015.1286]: Yeah
Ses01M_script01_3_F001 [014.5812-020.0400]: Oh it's not bad thing it's good thing.
Ses01M_script01_3_F002 [020.7769-027.6000]: You know it's nice here
Ses01M_script01_3_M001 [028.1000-030.5850]: You're not sorry you came?
Ses01M_script01_3_F003 [030.1500-038.2445]: Not sorry
Ses01M_script01_3_M002 [038.4600-041.3299]: Why not?
Ses01M_script01_3_F004 [040.8100-044.5425]: For one thing your mother as much as told me to go.
Ses01M_script01_3_M003 [044.1700-046.0650]: Well.
Ses01M_script01_3_F005 [045.7500-051.2332]: [BREATHING] And then you've been kind of...
Ses01M_script01_3_M004 [051.0590-053.2700]: What?
Ses01M_script01_3_F006 [053.7700-059.2200]: You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.
Ses01M_script01_3_M005 [063.7100-077.5575]: I was kind of planning on sneaking up on you
Ses01M_script01_3_F007 [076.8200-080.3200]: I knew they would
Ses01M_script01_3_M006 [079.4100-081.1172]: You did?
Ses01M_script01_3_F008 [080.6400-085.2800]: From her point of view why else would I come?
Ses01M_script01_3_M007 [085.7000-088.3580]: Yeah--
Ses01M_script01_3_M008 [088.7200-102.1500]: So then would you want to?  I mean I guess
Ses01M_script01_3_F009 [104.1500-109.6300]: Well I guess that's why I came.
Ses01M_script01_3_M009 [111.9467-120.1828]: Ann
Ses01M_script01_3_M010 [122.3000-126.0750]: I love you a great deal.
Ses01M_script01_3_M011 [126.5900-130.9400]: I'm sorry I don't really have much of an imagination.
Ses01M_script01_3_F010 [148.7000-150.8000]: Chris

Ses01M_script01_3_M012 [132.7800-147.9500]: I'm sorry I'm embarrassing you
Ses01M_script01_3_F011 [150.8300-154.1400]: I've been ready a long
Ses01M_script01_3_M013 [156.2200-161.5000]: So then he's gone.  You sure?
Ses01M_script01_3_F012 [161.9300-165.3000]: I almost got married two years ago.
Ses01M_script01_3_M014 [165.6682-167.9300]: Why didn't you?
Ses01M_script01_3_F013 [167.8525-170.4900]: You started to write me.
Ses01M_script01_3_M015 [171.1174-174.5900]: You felt something that far back?
Ses01M_script01_3_F014 [173.6300-175.6300]: Everyday since.
Ses01M_script01_3_M016 [175.3300-178.0700]: why didn't you let me know?
Ses01M_script01_3_F015 [177.1300-185.6300]: Because I was waiting for you
Ses01M_script01_3_M017 [184.6500-194.6563]: Oh Annie
Ses01M_script01_3_M018 [197.0000-201.8600]: I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.
Ses01M_script01_3_F016 [200.9400-207.6450]: I'll never forgive you for waiting so long.  All I did was sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking about you.
Ses01M_script01_3_M019 [207.1800-210.0400]: I kissed you.
Ses01M_script01_3_F017 [215.8800-221.4300]: Like Larry's brother.  Do what like you
Ses01M_script01_3_F018 [225.0200-227.3023]: Chris
Ses01M_script01_3_M020 [228.2800-232.2300]: Do you want to go somewhere?  Let's go.
Ses01M_script01_3_F019 [231.3600-235.2050]: No
Ses01M_script01_3_M021 [234.5900-238.4800]: No
Ses01M_script01_3_F020 [236.9900-243.4400]: Well
Ses01M_script01_3_M022 [244.1400-252.9200]: I don't know it's--it's complicated. But it's going from me now.
F: You got to...
Ses01M_script01_3_F021 [253.4100-256.4398]: You got to tell me.
Ses01M_script01_3_M023 [256.1412-259.1271]: I don't know.
F: But what if...
Ses01M_script01_3_M024 [259.3510-263.9700]: It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things.
Ses01M_script01_3_F022 [265.5717-269.0800]: Wouldn't work like this.
Ses01M_script01_3_M025 [272.3400-277.8637]: you know over seas I was in command of the company?
Ses01M_script01_3_F023 [277.2300-279.3900]: Yeah
Ses01M_script01_3_M026 [281.1400-283.9100]: Well I lost them.
Ses01M_script01_3_F024 [285.5100-288.3400]: How many?
Ses01M_script01_3_M027 [288.1800-291.0300]: Pretty much all.
Ses01M_script01_3_F025 [290.5787-293.7900]: [BREATHING]. Geez.
Ses01M_script01_3_M028 [293.6392-307.4900]: Takes awhile to toss something like that off.  I mean they weren't just men
Ses01M_script01_3_M029 [307.7375-320.0300]: For instance
Ses01M_script01_3_M030 [320.1175-326.5000]: He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had.
Ses01M_script01_3_M031 [327.3700-337.8600]: They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly
Ses01M_script01_3_M032 [339.8710-363.7300]: And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed
Ses01M_script01_3_M033 [363.8650-373.3200]: You know
Ses01M_script01_3_M034 [374.5675-388.8175]: I thought I would change everything you know
Ses01M_script01_3_M035 [389.0888-397.0950]: You know.  I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again...
Ses01M_script01_3_M036 [397.3498-405.6900]: And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them.
Ses01M_script01_3_M037 [406.2000-414.2600]: Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator.
Ses01M_script01_3_M038 [417.2900-430.7600]: 'Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man...
Ses01M_script01_3_M039 [431.0408-439.0700]: And if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it.
Ses01M_script01_3_M040 [439.4800-449.9100]: I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it.  I guess I included you too.
Ses01M_script01_3_F026 [455.2600-458.7400]: Do you still feel that way?
Ses01M_script01_3_M041 [460.4000-463.8500]: I want you to know Annie.
Ses01M_script01_3_F027 [464.0599-472.8700]: 'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Everything you have
Ses01M_script01_3_F028 [473.5225-480.1500]: Everything Chris do you understand that?  To me too...
Ses01M_script01_3_F029 [481.6500-495.6700]: And your money there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes into the air.  You should be proud of that a man should be paid for that.
Ses01M_script01_3_M042 [499.4600-502.2700]: Annie...
Ses01M_script01_3_M043 [507.7700-511.4612]: I'm going to make a fortune for you.
Ses01M_script01_3_F030 [510.6900-513.8625]: What would I do with a fortune?
Ses01M_script02_1_M000 [003.3988-008.5500]: What time is it?  God
Ses01M_script02_1_M001 [009.0475-021.0500]: Of course I did want to a little further up the coast you know get away from all the lights and people and everything.  Is it midnight
Ses01M_script02_1_F000 [018.9629-020.8200]: I'm fine.
Ses01M_script02_1_M002 [021.1025-026.0300]: Look
Ses01M_script02_1_M003 [026.9072-030.6700]: No
Ses01M_script02_1_F001 [030.3200-032.0500]: Ugh...
Ses01M_script02_1_M004 [031.7900-041.7119]: Oh
Ses01M_script02_1_M005 [041.8225-052.5650]: Gosh
Ses01M_script02_1_M006 [052.6225-058.5575]: My flashlight.  How could I forget my flashlight?  God--
Ses01M_script02_1_F002 [058.0400-060.0100]: What flashlight?
Ses01M_script02_1_M007 [059.4500-063.6475]: Flashlight the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?
Ses01M_script02_1_F003 [063.1300-065.7800]: That's not your flashlight.
Ses01M_script02_1_M008 [065.7200-067.5700]: Whose is it?
Ses01M_script02_1_F004 [067.0200-069.8200]: It's ours; it's my flashlight
Ses01M_script02_1_M009 [069.4100-071.2800]: Oh
Ses01M_script02_1_F005 [070.6900-075.3800]: You keep saying "my flashlight" like somehow it's just yours. How's that supposed to make me feel?
M: No.
Ses01M_script02_1_M010 [074.8900-081.7300]: Of course
Ses01M_script02_1_M011 [082.2739-087.4750]: Gosh
Ses01M_script02_1_M012 [088.3200-096.8200]: It's a nice moon though
Ses01M_script02_1_F006 [096.2700-098.1135]: Yeah.
Ses01M_script02_1_M013 [097.9122-105.1300]: Are you all right?  Are you okay?  You cold?  Do you want to my jacket? My jacket? No?
Ses01M_script02_1_F007 [101.3300-102.6100]: No.
Ses01M_script02_1_M014 [107.2700-124.6900]: You know what we should've brought a blanket too.  Man
Ses01M_script02_1_M015 [125.1356-128.4600]: What's wrong?  Are you okay?  Huh?  You cold?
Ses01M_script02_1_F008 [128.5550-130.3000]: I'm fine.
Ses01M_script02_1_M016 [134.9100-138.4300]: Oh yeah
Ses01M_script02_1_M017 [138.4900-142.9100]: I can't believe I got out of the house without my fly zipped up even.
M: Eek. Hehe. Oops.
Ses01M_script02_1_F009 [153.5100-155.7900]: I wonder if they can hear me talk
F:[Chuckles]
Ses01M_script02_1_M018 [155.5400-158.3500]: I wonder if they can hear me talking
Ses01M_script02_1_M019 [158.3800-161.6750]: Like feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around.
Ses01M_script02_1_F010 [161.6249-163.5475]: I'm cold.
Ses01M_script02_1_M020 [163.6278-166.5100]: Do you want my jacket?
Ses01M_script02_1_F011 [165.8000-168.6350]: It's after eleven
Ses01M_script02_1_M021 [168.0200-175.2200]: What are you kidding?  We just got here.  We don't want to turn around and go home now.  What's the point coming all the way down here?
Ses01M_script02_1_F012 [174.7000-176.8514]: There is no point.
Ses01M_script02_1_M022 [176.4900-178.1775]: Right.
Ses01M_script02_1_F013 [177.9600-180.1500]: That's my point.
Ses01M_script02_1_M023 [179.8000-182.6525]: That's my point too.
Ses01M_script02_1_F014 [182.1100-184.4100]: Then let's go.
Ses01M_script02_1_M024 [183.8200-191.9600]: No
Ses01M_script02_1_M025 [192.1200-194.0925]: Don't you want to see it?
Ses01M_script02_1_F015 [193.6200-195.9500]: Not particularly.
Ses01M_script02_1_M026 [195.3000-197.1400]: Why not?
Ses01M_script02_1_F016 [196.4800-199.8900]: I just don't
Ses01M_script02_1_M027 [200.4000-205.8000]: It's not stupid.  It's a natural phenomenon.
Ses01M_script02_1_M028 [205.8575-215.6599]: People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up.
Ses01M_script02_1_F017 [215.1712-224.1800]: Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean
Ses01M_script02_1_M029 [223.5940-238.3125]: Yeah but that like flopping around is what to do it's like spawning or mating or something.  This is like the highlight of their little fish lives.  It's like life's last orgy.
Ses01M_script02_1_F018 [237.7400-248.4000]: I don't know what you're so excited about.  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about
Ses01M_script02_1_M030 [247.9200-249.5200]: Yeah
Ses01M_script02_1_F019 [248.9900-251.1912]: Oh
Ses01M_script02_1_M031 [250.5900-266.3200]: Well
Ses01M_script02_1_M032 [266.4000-274.4825]: It's like a little bit of the unexplainable
Ses01M_script02_1_F020 [273.9800-276.1435]: I'm not.
Ses01M_script02_1_M033 [275.5000-277.3075]: For real?
Ses01M_script02_1_F021 [276.9400-278.4400]: Yes.
Ses01M_script02_1_M034 [279.6900-282.8100]: All right.
Ses01M_script02_1_M035 [289.5300-296.9725]: I don't get it though
Ses01M_script02_1_M036 [297.0800-305.0900]: And last year I remember like distinctively you were so excited to get here that you didn't realize you stubbed your toe until we were in a car.
Ses01M_script02_1_F022 [304.4200-318.4303]: Last year
Ses01M_script02_1_M037 [317.7800-320.0133]: We just weren't in a good spot though.
Ses01M_script02_1_F023 [319.6100-321.8200]: We didn't see them the year before either.
Ses01M_script02_1_M038 [321.2400-325.9100]: We just weren't in a good spot I'm telling you this is a much better spot.
Ses01M_script02_1_M039 [326.8820-338.7500]: Come on
Ses01M_script02_1_M040 [338.9269-347.0862]: Out there
Ses01M_script02_1_M041 [347.1150-355.9600]: They don't know why
Ses01M_script02_1_M042 [356.0100-367.2140]: They just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the California coast.  And they just started swimming...
Ses01M_script02_1_M043 [367.3200-375.7175]: Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies.  And they all turned as one...
Ses01M_script02_1_M044 [375.8875-383.5400]: And form the line and started swimming
Ses01M_script02_1_M045 [383.7800-391.4700]: It's like urgency that's pure urge you know.  It's single-mindedness with no mind.
Ses01M_script02_1_M046 [393.6300-401.8275]: It's crazy.  Look at this
Ses01M_script02_1_F024 [402.0100-405.0400]: That's the wind.
Ses01M_script02_2_M000 [001.8500-006.5924]: They're out there swimming right now...
Ses01M_script02_2_M001 [006.8900-015.1948]: ...to this spot for this massive celebration of like sex and death...
Ses01M_script02_2_M002 [015.9987-021.2600]: Look at this
Ses01M_script02_2_F000 [021.0588-023.3952]: That's the wind.
Ses01M_script02_2_M003 [023.4800-027.7100]: Well
Ses01M_script02_2_F001 [027.5800-029.9072]: About what?
Ses01M_script02_2_M004 [029.4650-031.7161]: About what I was saying.
Ses01M_script02_2_F002 [031.3400-034.3200]: I think it's ridiculous.
Ses01M_script02_2_M005 [035.1500-041.2600]: It certainly is not.  It's like slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
Ses01M_script02_2_F003 [040.7200-043.2000]: It's a PR.
Ses01M_script02_2_F004 [043.2300-048.3982]: Somebody sold you a bill of goods that something amazing is going to happen on the beach.
Ses01M_script02_2_M006 [048.9610-052.0600]: It's not just me
Ses01M_script02_2_F005 [051.5700-053.8100]: They're all told the same thing.
Ses01M_script02_2_F006 [053.8600-060.2968]: Everybody is believes that it keeps them excited
Ses01M_script02_2_F007 [060.3600-065.6400]: Everybody keeps thinking that they can just find the right spot
Ses01M_script02_2_F008 [065.6900-068.7785]: Their life will start then.
Ses01M_script02_2_M007 [070.2257-073.3600]: Are we talking about the same thing?
Ses01M_script02_2_F009 [073.0400-076.8100]: I'm sorry it still just fish to me.
Ses01M_script02_2_M008 [079.8400-084.9300]: Can I ask you a question?  Are you on your period?
Ses01M_script02_2_F010 [084.3550-091.7025]: Why do you ask me that?  God damn it
Ses01M_script02_2_M009 [090.9850-093.7900]: Okay
Ses01M_script02_2_F011 [093.1300-098.0700]: I just
Ses01M_script02_2_M010 [097.9700-104.6100]: Is not supposed to like anything.  We come down here
Ses01M_script02_2_F012 [104.1425-109.0200]: Oh. Grow up Augie
Ses01M_script02_2_M011 [104.6100-107.0800]: And then we go home and they go home.
Ses01M_script02_2_M012 [108.3575-109.8025]: Why not?
Ses01M_script02_2_F013 [109.2700-113.8000]: Because they never do.  Do they
Ses01M_script02_2_M013 [114.1000-116.5200]: We missed them twice.
Ses01M_script02_2_F014 [116.1300-119.3800]: Twice is every year we've tried that's ever.
Ses01M_script02_2_M014 [118.7775-123.1250]: Okay we'll see them this year
Ses01M_script02_2_F015 [121.2775-125.9375]: No we won't.  It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus.
Ses01M_script02_2_F016 [126.0225-137.5100]: I feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly
Ses01M_script02_2_M015 [137.4365-140.3043]: Okay
Ses01M_script02_2_F017 [141.9575-145.1545]: You don't understand anything I'm saying.
Ses01M_script02_2_M016 [140.3043-143.4071]: and figure out where we took a turn to the worst thing.
Ses01M_script02_2_M017 [144.5525-147.0975]: Of course not.
Ses01M_script02_2_F018 [146.8400-157.2400]: I did want to see it I still do
Ses01M_script02_2_M018 [158.0200-166.1675]: Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards here and I'm trying to figure out the exact moment that you took a turn for the worst here
Ses01M_script02_2_M019 [166.3600-174.7925]: you were fine during the phone call from Marge
Ses01M_script02_2_M020 [174.8850-184.7175]: Let's see
Ses01M_script02_2_M021 [184.8300-189.5425]: So I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and--
Ses01M_script02_2_F019 [189.0700-197.9100]: Do you remember the first year we came here? It's about four years ago right after we got married.
Ses01M_script02_2_F020 [198.0250-208.1600]: We thought I was pregnant we had this bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance so we took off our shoes.
Ses01M_script02_2_F021 [208.7300-221.1700]: While we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me
Ses01M_script02_2_F022 [222.6559-232.4642]: And I remember thinking this is it. finally
Ses01M_script02_2_M022 [232.3838-235.8500]: Wait a minute
Ses01M_script02_2_F023 [235.3400-241.2075]: Dancing on the beach barefoot
Ses01M_script02_2_M023 [241.5900-255.4550]: It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said
Ses01M_script02_2_M024 [255.5100-259.0275]: You want this to be like the other times
Ses01M_script02_2_F024 [258.5600-265.2255]: I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.
Ses01M_script02_2_M025 [265.3800-269.6874]: Oh right sure
Ses01M_script02_2_M026 [270.6120-273.1525]: Do you want to dance?
Ses01M_script02_2_F025 [273.3052-275.4759]: No.
Ses01M_script02_2_M027 [274.9100-277.7200]: You want me to go get some champagne?
Ses01M_script02_2_F026 [276.6600-278.5712]: No.
Ses01M_script02_2_M028 [279.5359-282.4301]: Do you want to take off our shoes?
Ses01M_script02_2_F027 [281.5975-283.4400]: No.
Ses01M_script02_2_M029 [283.5959-288.0578]: What? Huh?
Ses01M_script02_2_M030 [289.3844-293.8865]: You want to get married again?
Ses01M_script02_2_M031 [294.0375-299.4000]: What?  What?  You want to divorce?
Ses01M_script02_2_F028 [298.4600-300.3400]: No.
Ses01M_script02_2_M032 [299.9500-301.6900]: A vacation?
Ses01M_script02_2_F029 [301.0300-302.5000]: No.
Ses01M_script02_2_M033 [301.9800-308.7400]: A new carpet
Ses01M_script02_2_F030 [307.7400-311.3225]: I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.
Ses01M_script02_2_M034 [310.3372-312.7253]: Well
Ses01M_script02_2_M035 [312.7253-327.0096]: You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No.
Ses01M_script02_2_M036 [327.3500-337.2525]: You think there would be times when you'd look at me like I was used Kleenex and then I'd look at you and think "Holy hell when is the next flight to Alaska."
Ses01M_script02_2_M037 [337.3025-352.1575]: No
Ses01M_script02_2_M038 [352.7475-359.8914]: No.  You know what you get?  You know what you get?  You get this.
Ses01M_script02_2_F031 [359.5296-364.6775]: This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
Ses01M_script02_2_M039 [364.5650-365.9500]: Yeah
Ses01M_script02_2_F032 [365.5450-372.6025]: Oh
Ses01M_script02_2_M040 [372.4150-374.0700]: Right.
Ses01M_script02_2_F033 [373.8803-378.5200]: This isn't anything like I thought anything would be.
Ses01M_script02_2_M041 [378.5030-381.5100]: I know me neither.
Ses01M_script02_2_F034 [382.4500-394.0500]: This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's--do you understand what I'm saying?
Ses01M_script02_2_M042 [394.5500-397.9186]: I'm doing the best I can.
Ses01M_script02_2_F035 [397.6774-403.3800]: I know that Augie
Ses01M_script02_2_F036 [403.7875-412.0800]: I just can't help wishing that I was somebody
Ses01M_script02_2_M043 [413.9173-418.2500]: Maybe if you were with somebody else too?
Ses01M_script02_2_F037 [417.3550-419.3550]: I didn't say that.
Ses01M_script02_2_M044 [419.2600-425.9700]: No
Ses01M_script02_2_F038 [427.3434-435.4800]: Are you kidding me?  For heaven sake Augie anything I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.
Ses01M_script02_2_M045 [435.7448-437.6250]: Yeah?
Ses01M_script02_2_F039 [437.5175-442.3000]: Yes
Ses01M_script02_2_F040 [443.1010-453.7200]: You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else
Ses01M_script02_2_M046 [454.7986-463.2300]: Actually
Ses01M_script02_2_F041 [465.8800-472.4052]: So maybe we're in the wrong spot.  But we're with the right person.
Ses01M_script02_2_M047 [472.2846-478.6200]: I don't know
Ses01M_script02_2_M048 [479.8820-484.1975]: We do have really good view of the moon from here though.
Ses01M_script02_2_F042 [483.0575-490.6600]: Oh I saw that.  Pretty isn't it. Big ol' white moon.
Ses01M_script02_2_M049 [490.9800-494.4875]: Look what we got here.
Ses01M_script02_2_F043 [493.9915-498.4250]: Augie
Ses01M_script02_2_M050 [497.8775-500.0400]: It's not champagne.
Ses01M_script02_2_F044 [498.9575-503.2900]: I guess we don't need glasses.
Ses01M_script02_2_M051 [509.1461-513.8400]: Are you cold
Ses01M_script02_2_F045 [513.8090-521.4400]: I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this might be the spot after all.
Ses01M_script02_2_F046 [523.7100-526.5919]: Augie
Ses01M_script02_2_M052 [525.2750-528.0391]: Shh...
Ses01M_script02_2_M053 [528.9636-535.2345]: If we are really quiet
Ses01M_script02_2_F047 [535.9982-539.3749]: Or not.
Ses01M_script02_2_M054 [539.5758-542.2691]: Or not.
Ses01M_script03_1_M000 [005.8200-007.6225]: Good God.
Ses01M_script03_1_F000 [007.3698-009.4250]: Do you think it's them?
Ses01M_script03_1_M001 [009.2100-011.5500]: I wonder.
Ses01M_script03_1_F001 [011.1350-015.2126]: Freda is the only one who knows we are here. She wouldn't ring up.
Ses01M_script03_1_M002 [014.7657-016.8575]: Must be them then.
Ses01M_script03_1_F002 [016.3800-019.7400]: What we're going to do?
Ses01M_script03_1_M003 [020.2958-024.1903]: We're okay
Ses01M_script03_1_F003 [023.7700-026.6080]: Now and always sweet.
Ses01M_script03_1_M004 [026.2300-028.6800]: I don't care then.
Ses01M_script03_1_F004 [028.1700-030.7900]: It had to happen sooner or later.
Ses01M_script03_1_M005 [030.1400-040.5172]: Yes... Hello?  Hello?  I'm sorry what's that?
Ses01M_script03_1_M006 [040.6661-042.9600]: No
Ses01M_script03_1_F005 [044.2800-049.6300]: Oh
Ses01M_script03_1_M007 [048.8478-050.4450]: [BREATHING] [LAUGHTER]
Ses01M_script03_1_F006 [049.7800-051.3325]: Oh...
Ses01M_script03_1_M008 [051.1167-052.3000]: [BREATHING]
Ses01M_script03_1_F007 [052.0100-053.2000]: [BREATHING]
Ses01M_script03_1_M009 [052.4300-055.4100]: What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?
Ses01M_script03_1_F008 [054.4200-056.9500]: Oh. Behave exquisitely...
Ses01M_script03_1_M010 [056.3600-058.9200]: With perfect poise...
Ses01M_script03_1_F009 [057.1675-061.0500]: [LAUGHTER] I think I shall do a court curtsey.
Ses01M_script03_1_M011 [060.0700-061.4025]: Ah...
Ses01M_script03_1_F010 [061.1400-062.5000]: [LAUGHTER]
Ses01M_script03_1_M012 [061.9400-063.7624]: Ah...Strange...
Ses01M_script03_1_F011 [063.4700-064.7675]: Mmm...
Ses01M_script03_1_M013 [064.3200-069.9700]: Things that just ought to matter dreadfully
Ses01M_script03_1_F012 [069.3900-072.7000]: The pity is that one can't stay happy.
Ses01M_script03_1_M014 [072.2700-074.5800]: Darling
Ses01M_script03_1_F013 [074.0900-077.5175]: It's true.  I think the whole things a very poor joke.
Ses01M_script03_1_M015 [077.0200-080.8200]: What
Ses01M_script03_1_F014 [080.0300-082.8964]: Oh
Ses01M_script03_1_M016 [082.3473-088.4000]: Oh
Ses01M_script03_1_F015 [086.9900-090.7600]: [LAUGHTER] Don't laugh at me I'm being serious.
Ses01M_script03_1_M017 [090.0900-093.7700]: You mustn't be so serious
Ses01M_script03_1_F016 [092.9100-094.9100]: Oh whose they?
Ses01M_script03_1_M018 [094.3500-099.8850]: Oh you know all those superficial philosophers. We must laugh at them
Ses01M_script03_1_M019 [099.9150-106.2707]: Flippancy brings out the acid in their darn sweetness and light.
Ses01M_script03_1_F017 [104.8300-108.7600]: Mmhmm If I must laugh at everything
Ses01M_script03_1_M020 [108.2600-109.4000]: Oh yes.  .
Ses01M_script03_1_F018 [111.5526-117.7531]: How long will it last
Ses01M_script03_1_M021 [109.4400-112.1700]: We are figures of fun all right
M: Mmhmm...
Ses01M_script03_1_M022 [117.2200-119.8100]: Ahh...who knows.
Ses01M_script03_1_F019 [119.1500-122.5384]: Shall we always want to bicker and fight?
Ses01M_script03_1_M023 [121.8100-127.4900]: No
Ses01M_script03_1_F020 [126.9325-130.2975]: Oh
Ses01M_script03_1_M024 [129.7700-133.2600]: Well it depends on how well we've played.
Ses01M_script03_1_F021 [133.9500-137.0400]: If one of us dies...
F: Hmm...
Ses01M_script03_1_F022 [137.0400-139.5300]: does the one that's left still laugh?
Ses01M_script03_1_M025 [139.6316-143.1200]: Yes
Ses01M_script03_1_F023 [142.6100-145.6086]: Well
Ses01M_script03_1_M026 [145.2176-153.2056]: No
Ses01M_script03_1_F024 [152.6656-155.3500]: I think you're talking nonsense.
Ses01M_script03_1_M027 [154.5200-158.0950]: Ah so is everyone in the long run
Ses01M_script03_1_F025 [157.5600-158.9250]: Hmm.
Ses01M_script03_1_M028 [158.4500-172.7567]: Let's pity the poor philosophers
Ses01M_script03_1_F026 [172.1422-175.0655]: Ah.
Ses01M_script03_1_M029 [174.5256-177.9000]: Come here darling
Ses01M_script03_1_F027 [180.6200-185.4100]: Oh
Ses01M_script03_1_M030 [177.9900-181.6100]: before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.
M: [LAUGHTER] Ahh...
Ses01M_script03_1_M031 [189.3000-198.2100]: See
Ses01M_script03_1_F028 [205.5500-208.1500]: Oh
Ses01M_script03_1_M032 [198.2500-206.1500]: You could run off with all the men in a world. I won't say a word.  Just as long as you love me best.
M: Ahh...
Ses01M_script03_1_F029 [208.1700-215.0000]: The same applies to you too
Ses01M_script03_1_M033 [220.4300-223.7300]: Do you remember that row we did have in Venice?
Ses01M_script03_1_F030 [222.9000-226.0500]: Which particular one?
Ses01M_script03_1_M034 [225.5100-230.3900]: The one when you put that little wooden painted snake in my bed?
Ses01M_script03_1_F031 [229.5300-235.7800]: Oh
Ses01M_script03_1_M035 [234.2800-236.9000]: It was a horrible thing I hated it.
Ses01M_script03_1_F032 [236.0200-242.5000]: Oh I know you threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal.  Oh
Ses01M_script03_1_M036 [241.9859-245.7300]: Of course how long did that row last?
Ses01M_script03_1_F033 [245.2600-248.5425]: It went on intermittently for days.
Ses01M_script03_1_M037 [247.8600-257.2500]: But you know it wasn't as bad as the one we had in Cannes...mmhmm...where your curling irons burnt a hole in my dressing gown.
Ses01M_script03_1_F034 [251.4100-254.5525]: Cannes...mmhmm...
Ses01M_script03_1_F035 [256.0800-260.4000]: Oh it burnt my comb too and all those towels in the bathroom.
Ses01M_script03_1_M038 [259.6700-262.1500]: Oh that was a rouser wasn't it?
Ses01M_script03_1_F036 [263.0700-267.8200]: The manager came in he found us rolling about the floor.  [LAUGHTER]
Ses01M_script03_1_M039 [271.5500-275.8800]: I will never forget the look on his face.
Ses01M_script03_1_F037 [267.8400-272.5300]: Scratching and biting like panthers. [LAUGHTER] Oh...
Ses01M_script03_1_M040 [280.0900-282.9400]: oh...
Ses01M_script03_1_F038 [276.2400-279.0100]: Utterly
Ses01M_script03_1_F039 [280.9400-283.8275]: oh...[LAUGHTER]
Ses01M_script03_1_M041 [283.3100-285.7500]: We were very much younger then.
Ses01M_script03_1_F040 [285.0900-287.8400]: Very much sillier.
Ses01M_script03_1_M042 [289.3900-296.0399]: However
Ses01M_script03_1_F041 [295.4999-300.3411]: Oh you knew there was nothing in that.
Ses01M_script03_2_M000 [008.8900-010.5700]: [LAUGHTER]
Ses01M_script03_2_F000 [009.1274-012.4425]: [LAUGHTER] Utterly
Ses01M_script03_2_M001 [011.9100-013.7800]: We were very much younger then.
Ses01M_script03_2_F001 [013.1400-015.7700]: Very much sillier.
Ses01M_script03_2_M002 [014.5300-016.6600]: Mmhmm.
Ses01M_script03_2_M003 [017.1948-022.5087]: However
Ses01M_script03_2_F002 [022.0335-026.6200]: Oh you knew there was nothing in that.
Ses01M_script03_2_M004 [025.5100-030.3200]: I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.
Ses01M_script03_2_F003 [029.6100-034.1900]: Presents? It was a trivial little broach.
Ses01M_script03_2_M005 [033.4300-037.3100]: It was bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.
Ses01M_script03_2_F004 [036.6200-041.2588]: Not at all. It was very pretty. I still wear it often.
Ses01M_script03_2_M006 [040.6323-046.4500]: You sent out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses01M_script03_2_F005 [045.4500-049.7800]: I did not you worked whole thing up in your jealous imagination.
Ses01M_script03_2_M007 [048.8400-054.1300]: Well
Ses01M_script03_2_F006 [053.5900-055.8830]: Well
Ses01M_script03_2_M008 [055.5157-057.7839]: What of it?
Ses01M_script03_2_F007 [057.3735-063.4867]: It gave him a lot
Ses01M_script03_2_M009 [062.8602-065.9708]: And what about me?
Ses01M_script03_2_F008 [065.6468-070.4725]: If you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you'd never known a thing about it.
Ses01M_script03_2_M010 [070.2675-073.5745]: That's a nice point of view I must say.
Ses01M_script03_2_F009 [073.7041-077.9800]: I'm bored with this conversation.
Ses01M_script03_2_M011 [077.2200-084.2457]: So am I.  I'm bored stiff.  You want some brandy?
Ses01M_script03_2_F010 [083.7100-086.1400]: No
Ses01M_script03_2_M012 [085.7100-089.0750]: I'll have a little
Ses01M_script03_2_F011 [088.6300-092.3800]: I don't see why you want any you already had two glasses.
Ses01M_script03_2_M013 [091.6800-097.8825]: Oh
Ses01M_script03_2_F012 [097.4225-103.9894]: I just think it's silly you know to go on and on and on about such a thing.
Ses01M_script03_2_M014 [103.3845-111.6100]: You can hardly call three glasses of liquor in a whole evening going on and on and on.
Ses01M_script03_2_F013 [111.9700-118.0700]: I just
Ses01M_script03_2_M015 [117.1200-123.7600]: Hmm.  Well
Ses01M_script03_2_F014 [123.2540-126.1575]: Do be quiet.
Ses01M_script03_2_M016 [125.4600-127.4000]: Really
Ses01M_script03_2_F015 [127.0800-129.8400]: Don't be stupid
Ses01M_script03_2_M017 [129.9327-133.3025]: Nothing.
Ses01M_script03_2_M018 [135.3979-138.1800]: Are you going out somewhere dear?
Ses01M_script03_2_F016 [137.7740-142.4325]: No
Ses01M_script03_2_M019 [141.8300-145.7234]: That reply has broken my heart.
Ses01M_script03_2_F017 [145.5800-151.5900]: Well it's a woman's duty to allure the man. Watch me a minute will you?
Ses01M_script03_2_M020 [152.4200-157.4700]: As matter the fact that's perfectly true.
Ses01M_script03_2_F018 [156.5300-158.8400]: Oh no
Ses01M_script03_2_M021 [158.7275-161.0388]: Yes
Ses01M_script03_2_F019 [160.7580-164.3200]: Don't be stupid
Ses01M_script03_2_M022 [165.1863-171.7100]: You know
Ses01M_script03_2_F020 [171.2500-177.4700]: Oh
Ses01M_script03_2_M023 [179.2200-184.3684]: You know what?  You snap
Ses01M_script03_2_F021 [184.1800-187.1600]: Adders don't snap
Ses01M_script03_2_M024 [186.5000-192.1500]: Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap.
Ses01M_script03_2_F022 [191.3700-193.1525]: They sting.
M: They snap.
Ses01M_script03_2_F023 [193.1875-200.3318]: I don't care.  I don't care
Ses01M_script03_2_M025 [200.0078-203.7500]: Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
Ses01M_script03_2_F024 [202.9700-206.0400]: Yes
Ses01M_script03_2_M026 [205.0800-209.0000]: I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too.
Ses01M_script03_2_F025 [207.4700-209.6700]: Oh
Ses01M_script03_2_M027 [209.1700-215.8300]: I suppose you two had a riotous time
Ses01M_script03_2_F026 [215.0200-218.7700]: You're quite insufferable
Ses01M_script03_2_M028 [218.2500-221.0700]: I am not in the least bit drunk.
Ses01M_script03_2_F027 [220.2500-222.7000]: You always had a weak head.
Ses01M_script03_2_M029 [222.0100-231.2375]: I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A Child of two cannot get drunk on that.
Ses01M_script03_2_F028 [230.5800-236.6800]: On the contrary
Ses01M_script03_2_M030 [236.1100-248.5725]: Oh very
Ses01M_script03_2_F029 [243.2700-245.2725]: Shut up.
Ses01M_script03_2_F030 [248.0800-251.5900]: Not very funny darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy?
Ses01M_script03_2_M031 [250.6300-253.9800]: That's a very good idea I think I will.
Ses01M_script03_2_M032 [255.0051-260.8300]: Would you uh...turn that off please? You're going to wake the people upstairs.
Ses01M_script03_2_F031 [258.3000-259.5200]: Why?
Ses01M_script03_2_F032 [260.2900-264.2000]: There are no people upstairs. It's a photographer's studio.
Ses01M_script03_2_M033 [264.1300-266.6825]: Well then you'll wake the people downstairs.
Ses01M_script03_2_F033 [266.2400-268.7700]: They are away in Tunis.
Ses01M_script03_2_M034 [268.7600-271.9275]: This is no time a year for Tunis.
Ses01M_script03_2_F034 [272.5100-275.3400]: Turn it on again
Ses01M_script03_2_M035 [274.8300-277.8275]: I will do no such thing.
Ses01M_script03_2_F035 [277.3500-282.3600]: Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
Ses01M_script03_2_M036 [282.5900-286.4300]: Turn it off. It's driving me mad.
Ses01M_script03_2_F036 [284.3900-286.0500]: I won't.
Ses01M_script03_2_M037 [287.6400-291.1950]: Turn it off.
Ses01M_script03_2_F037 [290.7500-293.3400]: Stop it. No. Go away.
Ses01M_script03_2_M038 [292.4900-294.5750]: Amanda listen. Listen.
Ses01M_script03_2_F038 [293.3600-298.5300]: listen Oh I'm sick and tired of listening to you
Ses01M_script03_2_M039 [297.9200-300.0800]: That's very amusing indeed.
Ses01M_script03_2_F039 [299.6300-309.0100]: Oh you're cruel you're...you're...I hate you
Ses01M_script03_2_M040 [304.2700-311.8500]: You...You're an evil minded
Ses01M_script03_2_F040 [311.8125-316.7100]: This is the end do you hear me?  Finally and forever.
Ses01M_script03_2_M041 [316.7900-319.0800]: You're not going like this.
Ses01M_script03_2_F041 [318.4000-337.3200]: Oh yes I am...Oh yes I am. Let go of me. You let go. You...urgh...You're a cruel friend. I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again...Ha...Never
Ses01M_script03_2_M042 [319.1300-320.8500]: No you're not.
Ses01M_script03_2_M043 [321.5200-335.7700]: Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are an evil tempered little vampire and I never want to see you again as long as I live.
