Ses05F_impro07_M035 [175.5500-178.9500]: Good.  We'll have to have one soon
Ses05F_impro07_F038 [177.2100-179.1400]: Woo-
Ses05F_impro07_M036 [179.0466-185.3300]: Oh God
Ses05F_impro07_F039 [179.6000-180.7600]: exciting.
Ses05F_script01_1_F000 [008.0341-013.5000]: What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.
Ses05F_script01_1_M000 [013.0842-015.2700]: He saw it.
Ses05F_script01_1_F001 [015.2259-019.1000]: How could he see it?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.
Ses05F_script01_1_M001 [018.6100-021.0200]: He was out here when it broke.
Ses05F_script01_1_F002 [020.5700-022.1000]: When?
Ses05F_script01_1_M002 [022.0700-029.1500]: Around Four this morning
Ses05F_script01_1_F003 [028.9800-032.1300]: What was he doing out here at four in the morning?
Ses05F_script01_1_M003 [031.9700-038.2200]: I don't know.  but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.
Ses05F_script01_1_F004 [038.1100-039.8800]: Did you talk to him?
Ses05F_script01_1_M004 [039.8400-044.0600]: No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.
Ses05F_script01_1_F005 [044.6200-046.4500]: He cried hard.
Ses05F_script01_1_M005 [046.1100-049.3300]: I could hear him right through the floor of my room.
Ses05F_script01_1_F006 [050.9500-053.3100]: He is thinking about him again.
Ses05F_script01_1_F007 [053.6400-058.7700]: It's getting just like after Larry died
Ses05F_script01_1_M006 [058.6000-060.6600]: I guess
Ses05F_script01_1_F008 [061.9800-064.2300]: What's the meaning of that?
Ses05F_script01_1_M007 [063.8000-070.2300]: I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.
Ses05F_script01_1_F009 [069.6000-071.3200]: What?
Ses05F_script01_1_M008 [071.0800-075.9100]: Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.
Ses05F_script01_1_F010 [075.4300-077.8500]: What do you mean
Ses05F_script01_1_M009 [077.5600-085.4600]: You know that Larry's not coming back
Ses05F_script01_1_F011 [085.0200-087.5900]: What are you going to do
Ses05F_script01_1_M010 [087.2500-093.7000]: No um
Ses05F_script01_1_M011 [094.0900-105.2700]: Why shouldn't he dream about him
Ses05F_script01_1_F012 [105.0300-106.9000]: You can't just say that to him.
Ses05F_script01_1_M012 [106.7400-108.9400]: We have to say it to him!
Ses05F_script01_1_F013 [118.0100-125.0000]: How are you going to prove it
Ses05F_script01_1_M013 [122.8100-129.6100]: For God's sake
Ses05F_script01_1_F014 [128.5500-138.3700]: To you it is
Ses05F_script01_1_M014 [138.4900-142.2100]: Sit down
Ses05F_script01_1_F015 [141.5300-150.1700]: The trouble with the god damned newspapers
Ses05F_script01_1_M015 [148.2000-151.9200]: All right
Ses05F_script01_1_M016 [153.2090-156.5500]: You know why I asked Annie here
Ses05F_script01_1_F016 [156.1600-157.9000]: why?
Ses05F_script01_1_M017 [157.7200-159.5100]: You know.
Ses05F_script01_1_F017 [159.1900-162.2800]: Well I got an idea.  But what's the story?
Ses05F_script01_1_M018 [162.0800-164.5700]: I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses05F_script01_1_F018 [165.7700-169.1800]: Well that's nobody's business but yours
Ses05F_script01_1_M019 [168.7200-171.3000]: You know that's not just my business.
Ses05F_script01_1_F019 [170.7000-174.9700]: What- What am - what are you going to do
Ses05F_script01_1_M020 [174.2700-176.6900]: So it's all right.  I can go ahead with it then?
Ses05F_script01_1_F020 [176.2300-180.0200]: Well you're want to make sure your father isn't you know going to--lose them
Ses05F_script01_1_M021 [178.5600-186.7900]: Then it's not only my business.  Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?
Ses05F_script01_1_M022 [186.8200-195.4100]: You know that?  Isn't it your business too
Ses05F_script01_1_F021 [194.8000-198.4600]: I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.
Ses05F_script01_1_M023 [197.5100-200.2100]: She's not Larry's girl!
Ses05F_script01_1_F022 [200.0900-207.4100]: As far as your father is concerned
Ses05F_script01_1_F023 [207.4700-217.9800]: Now Chris you can go on from there
Ses05F_script01_1_M024 [218.6600-228.4200]: I don't know why it is.  But every time I reach out for something I want
Ses05F_script01_1_F024 [227.4700-230.8100]: Well you're a considerate fellow
Ses05F_script01_1_M025 [229.6600-231.7700]: To hell with that!
Ses05F_script01_1_F025 [232.1700-235.1600]: Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?
Ses05F_script01_1_M026 [234.5300-237.3600]: I want to get this settled first.
Ses05F_script01_1_F026 [237.5200-243.8800]: Well how did you know that she will go along with it
Ses05F_script01_1_M027 [243.4500-256.9600]: Well
Ses05F_script01_1_F027 [260.3300-263.3300]: The trouble is you don't see enough women
Ses05F_script01_1_M028 [262.7400-265.7900]: So what
Ses05F_script01_1_F028 [265.2100-268.0400]: Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses05F_script01_1_M029 [267.4100-269.0700]: Because it is.
Ses05F_script01_1_F029 [268.8500-273.3400]: well
Ses05F_script01_1_M030 [274.5500-285.9500]: I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here
Ses05F_script01_1_F030 [284.9400-294.2000]: No
Ses05F_script01_1_F031 [294.6600-304.5800]: You marry his girl
Ses05F_script01_1_M031 [304.2500-306.5200]: All right
Ses05F_script01_1_F032 [307.6800-309.7800]: Give it some more thought.
Ses05F_script01_1_M032 [309.4400-322.8500]: I've given it three years of thought.  And hope by now that he wouldn't.  Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy.  But that can't happen here
Ses05F_script01_1_F033 [323.1800-324.6400]: What the hell is this?
Ses05F_script01_1_M033 [324.2500-328.7500]: I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe
Ses05F_script01_1_F034 [328.2100-330.0200]: Are you crazy?
Ses05F_script01_1_M034 [329.4500-333.5500]: I've been a good son for too long
Ses05F_script01_1_F035 [333.8000-339.3800]: Wait a minute.  Tell me this.  Do you mean to say that you would leave the business?
Ses05F_script01_1_M035 [338.6600-342.5600]: The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?
Ses05F_script01_1_F036 [341.6300-343.8900]: Must you be inspired?
Ses05F_script01_1_M036 [342.8400-362.9200]: Yes!  I like it an hour a day.  If I had to grub for money all day long
Ses05F_script01_1_F037 [364.5700-368.9800]: Don't- you
Ses05F_script01_1_M037 [370.3600-372.4700]: Then help me stay here.
Ses05F_script01_1_F038 [372.5800-381.3700]: All right!  But don't think like that
Ses05F_script01_1_M038 [379.1600-385.1300]: I know that Mom. I know.  Just you help me stay here.
Ses05F_script01_1_F039 [384.5100-387.0300]: All right
Ses05F_script01_1_M039 [386.6800-388.9000]: I am thinking like that.
Ses05F_script01_1_F040 [390.4200-393.2500]: I don't understand you
Ses05F_script01_1_M040 [392.6800-397.7400]: No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses05F_script01_1_F041 [397.2900-399.9100]: Yeah
Ses05F_script01_2_F000 [004.4900-007.2200]: Why did you invite her here?
Ses05F_script01_2_M000 [007.1900-009.3200]: Why does that bother you?
Ses05F_script01_2_F001 [009.3700-013.3300]: She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why all of the sudden?
Ses05F_script01_2_M001 [012.8300-017.9000]: Well maybe.  Maybe she just wanted to see her again.
Ses05F_script01_2_F002 [016.7800-019.8800]: Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
Ses05F_script01_2_M002 [019.4700-029.2400]: What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life
Ses05F_script01_2_F003 [029.5700-032.1300]: He's not going to marry her.
Ses05F_script01_2_M003 [031.7600-034.4200]: How do you know he is even thinking about it?
Ses05F_script01_2_F004 [033.0100-035.0100]: It's got that about it.
Ses05F_script01_2_M004 [035.4500-038.3100]: Well
Ses05F_script01_2_F005 [038.4700-040.6800]: What's going on here
Ses05F_script01_2_M005 [040.4400-043.9600]: Now
Ses05F_script01_2_F006 [047.9200-050.4500]: She's not his girl.  She knows she's not.
Ses05F_script01_2_M006 [050.2000-052.0600]: You can't read her mind.
Ses05F_script01_2_F007 [052.1900-061.8200]: She's . . . Then why is she still single.  New York is full of men
Ses05F_script01_2_M007 [061.2300-064.0100]: How do you know why she's waited?
Ses05F_script01_2_F008 [063.4600-071.2600]: Because she knows what I know - she's faithful as a rock and my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.
Ses05F_script01_2_M008 [070.5400-075.4300]: Look.  It's a nice day.  Why are we arguing?
Ses05F_script01_2_F009 [078.7300-086.9200]: Nobody in her- this house dares shake her faith.  Strangers might
Ses05F_script01_2_M009 [086.1600-088.9000]: What do you want me to do? What do you want--
Ses05F_script01_2_F010 [087.9900-091.1800]: I want you to pretend like he's coming back!
Ses05F_script01_2_M010 [094.5700-096.2900]: But
Ses05F_script01_2_F011 [097.1700-100.4800]: Because if he's not coming back
Ses05F_script01_2_M011 [100.1500-101.3800]: [LAUGHTER]
Ses05F_script01_2_F012 [100.8700-109.0700]: Laugh.  Laugh at me
Ses05F_script01_2_M012 [109.5800-111.5000]: Calm yourself.
Ses05F_script01_2_F013 [111.4700-114.7300]: Believe with me
Ses05F_script01_2_M013 [113.9000-115.6400]: Calm yourself!
Ses05F_script01_2_F014 [122.2700-127.9100]: Only last week
Ses05F_script01_2_M014 [127.1600-131.4200]: All right
Ses05F_script01_2_F015 [131.9700-135.5000]: You above all
Ses05F_script01_2_M015 [135.2500-138.2600]: Why me
Ses05F_script01_2_F016 [140.5500-142.8900]: You've got to believe. You've got to--
Ses05F_script01_2_M016 [142.3800-146.3500]: What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking!
Ses05F_script01_2_F017 [145.6600-147.3200]: I can't help it!
Ses05F_script01_2_M017 [146.9900-151.8500]: What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you
Ses05F_script01_2_F000 [004.4900-007.2200]: Why did you invite her here?
Ses05F_script01_2_M000 [007.1900-009.3200]: Why does that bother you?
Ses05F_script01_2_F001 [009.3700-013.3300]: She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why all of the sudden?
Ses05F_script01_2_M001 [012.8300-017.9000]: Well maybe.  Maybe she just wanted to see her again.

Ses05F_script01_2_M003 [031.7600-034.4200]: How do you know he is even thinking about it?
Ses05F_script01_2_F004 [033.0100-035.0100]: It's got that about it.
Ses05F_script01_2_M004 [035.4500-038.3100]: Well
Ses05F_script01_2_F005 [038.4700-040.6800]: What's going on here
Ses05F_script01_2_M005 [040.4400-043.9600]: Now
Ses05F_script01_2_F006 [047.9200-050.4500]: She's not his girl.  She knows she's not.
Ses05F_script01_2_M006 [050.2000-052.0600]: You can't read her mind.
Ses05F_script01_2_F007 [052.1900-061.8200]: She's . . . Then why is she still single.  New York is full of men

Ses05F_script01_2_M010 [094.5700-096.2900]: But
Ses05F_script01_2_F011 [097.1700-100.4800]: Because if he's not coming back
Ses05F_script01_2_M011 [100.1500-101.3800]: [LAUGHTER]
Ses05F_script01_2_F012 [100.8700-109.0700]: Laugh.  Laugh at me
Ses05F_script01_2_M012 [109.5800-111.5000]: Calm yourself.
Ses05F_script01_2_F013 [111.4700-114.7300]: Believe with me
Ses05F_script01_2_M013 [113.9000-115.6400]: Calm yourself!
Ses05F_script01_2_F014 [122.2700-127.9100]: Only last week
Ses05F_script01_2_M014 [127.1600-131.4200]: All right
Ses05F_script01_2_F015 [131.9700-135.5000]: You above all
Ses05F_script01_2_M015 [135.2500-138.2600]: Why me
Ses05F_script01_2_F016 [140.5500-142.8900]: You've got to believe. You've got to--
Ses05F_script01_2_M016 [142.3800-146.3500]: What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking!
Ses05F_script01_2_F017 [145.6600-147.3200]: I can't help it!
Ses05F_script01_2_M017 [146.9900-151.8500]: What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you
Ses05F_script01_3_F000 [005.4211-008.7432]: You're the only one I know who loves his parents.
Ses05F_script01_3_M000 [008.3326-012.4188]: I know.  It's going out of style isn't it?
Ses05F_script01_3_F001 [011.8580-013.6306]: No
Ses05F_script01_3_F002 [015.3432-020.1605]: It's so lovely here.  The air is sweet.
Ses05F_script01_3_M001 [020.2306-022.3539]: So you're not sorry you came?
Ses05F_script01_3_F003 [021.9032-026.8707]: No.  But I'm not going to stay.
Ses05F_script01_3_M002 [027.1111-028.6434]: Why?
Ses05F_script01_3_F004 [028.6434-031.5600]: Well your mother has much as told me to leave.
Ses05F_script01_3_M003 [031.0871-032.1086]: Well--
Ses05F_script01_3_F005 [031.8182-039.2895]: Well
Ses05F_script01_3_M004 [039.0692-040.6300]: What?
Ses05F_script01_3_F006 [041.1223-044.5000]: Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came.
Ses05F_script01_3_M005 [044.9982-055.0133]: Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so.  But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set.
Ses05F_script01_3_F007 [055.0634-059.4100]: I figured they would- your mother at least.
Ses05F_script01_3_M006 [060.0410-062.4200]: How did you know?
Ses05F_script01_3_F008 [062.5848-066.9114]: Well
Ses05F_script01_3_M007 [067.1718-079.4103]: Well
Ses05F_script01_3_F009 [080.2716-084.1875]: I guess this is why I came.
Ses05F_script01_3_M008 [085.5400-094.3100]: Anne
Ses05F_script01_3_M009 [094.3104-109.8564]: I- I -I have no imagination
Ses05F_script01_3_M010 [110.0000-122.3654]: You feel it's wrong here
Ses05F_script01_3_F010 [121.9347-125.1796]: Chris
Ses05F_script01_3_M011 [125.0194-128.9253]: Then
Ses05F_script01_3_F011 [128.9754-132.4406]: I almost got married two years ago.
Ses05F_script01_3_M012 [132.8012-135.4151]: Why didn't you?
Ses05F_script01_3_F012 [135.0145-137.1700]: You started to write me.
Ses05F_script01_3_M013 [138.5399-140.9135]: You felt something that far back?
Ses05F_script01_3_F013 [139.9420-141.4700]: Every day since.
Ses05F_script01_3_M014 [141.8148-144.3186]: Annie
Ses05F_script01_3_F014 [143.3972-153.5827]: Well I was waiting for you!  I mean I didn't-until then you hadn't written and when you write- when you wrote what did you say?  I mean you sure can be ambiguous Chris.
Ses05F_script01_3_M015 [153.7129-157.2081]: Give me a kiss
Ses05F_script01_3_M016 [157.7790-166.9028]: Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this.
Ses05F_script01_3_F015 [174.8649-182.3262]: I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've been wondering if I was a fool for thinking of you!
Ses05F_script01_3_M017 [181.5650-186.7930]: Oh Annie
Ses05F_script01_3_F016 [187.2937-189.6000]: Not like that
Ses05F_script01_3_M018 [189.6673-191.5201]: I kissed you.
Ses05F_script01_3_F017 [191.1696-199.0315]: Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you
Ses05F_script01_3_M019 [199.9128-203.0600]: Let's Let's drive someplace.  I- I want to be alone with you.
Ses05F_script01_3_F018 [202.5468-204.5999]: No
Ses05F_script01_3_M020 [204.1092-206.7232]: No
Ses05F_script01_3_F019 [208.8263-215.3462]: What is it?  Even in your letters
Ses05F_script01_3_M021 [215.9071-222.6172]: Yeah
Ses05F_script01_3_M022 [225.4415-227.7550]: I don't know how to start.
Ses05F_script01_3_F020 [228.5963-231.1802]: It wouldn't work like this.
Ses05F_script01_3_M023 [232.5647-236.2579]: It's- It's mixed up with so many other things
Ses05F_script01_3_M024 [238.1007-242.0467]: Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.
Ses05F_script01_3_F021 [241.5760-243.2685]: yeah sure.
Ses05F_script01_3_M025 [244.7207-247.1344]: Yeah.  I lost them.
Ses05F_script01_3_F022 [247.4448-249.2376]: how many?
Ses05F_script01_3_M026 [249.9286-252.0118]: just about all.
Ses05F_script01_3_F023 [251.9617-253.9647]: Oh gee.
Ses05F_script01_3_M027 [255.6227-262.7380]: Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-
Ses05F_script01_3_M028 [264.1301-276.4087]: for instance
Ses05F_script01_3_M029 [276.8093-291.7100]: I know that- that's not a big thing
Ses05F_script01_3_M030 [291.7219-296.8998]: I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.
Ses05F_script01_3_M031 [298.4020-308.0466]: And I got an ideal
Ses05F_script01_3_M032 [308.2770-319.1635]: but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time
Ses05F_script01_3_M033 [319.6242-333.7856]: And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.
Ses05F_script01_3_M034 [337.0306-347.2400]: And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.
Ses05F_script01_3_M035 [349.3378-361.0570]: It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad
Ses05F_script01_3_M036 [363.4706-376.4700]: And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and
Ses05F_script01_3_M037 [377.3900-393.2457]: It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean
Ses05F_script01_3_M038 [393.2758-402.6099]: And if you're not
Ses05F_script01_3_F024 [404.1923-406.6600]: Do you still feel like that?
Ses05F_script01_3_M039 [407.9600-410.7823]: I I want you now
Ses05F_script01_3_F025 [410.4317-427.7079]: Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris
Ses05F_script01_3_M040 [426.7965-431.8242]: Oh Annie.  Annie
Ses05F_script01_3_F026 [431.1832-434.1377]: What would I do with a fortune?
Ses05F_script02_1_M000 [006.8800-016.2270]: What time is it?  Isn't it supposed to start running around midnight?  This is great
Ses05F_script02_1_M001 [016.2508-022.6606]: actually I was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid I will miss it.  How are you doing?
Ses05F_script02_1_F000 [022.9600-024.8051]: Fine.
Ses05F_script02_1_M002 [024.7200-038.9590]: Is that--no
Ses05F_script02_1_M003 [038.9828-046.0000]: Oh no
Ses05F_script02_1_F001 [045.2100-047.1300]: What flashlight?
Ses05F_script02_1_M004 [046.5700-049.2500]: The flashlight
Ses05F_script02_1_F002 [048.2700-050.7900]: It's not your flashlight.
Ses05F_script02_1_M005 [049.9600-051.9300]: Whose is it?
Ses05F_script02_1_F003 [051.3700-055.5800]: It's ours- our flashlight.  It's yours and mine.
Ses05F_script02_1_M006 [054.6141-055.9800]: Well
Ses05F_script02_1_F004 [055.6864-061.2400]: I mean you keep saying 
Ses05F_script02_1_M007 [059.8800-069.6700]: No
Ses05F_script02_1_M008 [069.7211-078.1400]: Well
Ses05F_script02_1_F005 [077.8800-079.0300]: yes.
Ses05F_script02_1_M009 [079.8900-088.7360]: Are you cold?  You want my jacket?  We should have bought a blanket.  Our blanket-.  This is great
Ses05F_script02_1_M010 [088.7598-100.1973]: I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the thing right about now. I can't believe I forgot.  And look at kid
Ses05F_script02_1_M011 [100.2500-108.8959]: [LAUGHTER] I wonder if they can hear me talk or if they can feel the vibration in the sand when we are moving around
Ses05F_script02_1_F006 [107.5364-108.9661]: I am cold.
Ses05F_script02_1_M012 [108.9423-110.8723]: you want my jacket?
Ses05F_script02_1_F007 [111.2300-113.7400]: It's after eleven
Ses05F_script02_1_M013 [113.5000-119.7100]: Are you kidding?  We'd miss it. We just got here
Ses05F_script02_1_F008 [119.4100-121.9300]: There is no point in coming out here.
Ses05F_script02_1_M014 [121.1100-122.5243]: Right.
Ses05F_script02_1_F009 [122.5400-124.4800]: That's my point.
Ses05F_script02_1_M015 [123.4100-125.1400]: That's my point too.
Ses05F_script02_1_F010 [124.5259-125.7887]: So let's go.
Ses05F_script02_1_M016 [125.3700-133.6520]: No
Ses05F_script02_1_F011 [133.6759-135.9634]: Not particularly.
Ses05F_script02_1_M017 [135.6100-137.6075]: Why not?
Ses05F_script02_1_F012 [137.5700-139.6329]: I just don't.
Ses05F_script02_1_M018 [140.3700-147.6153]: Honey
Ses05F_script02_1_M019 [147.6392-157.1300]: Think about people in Kansas
Ses05F_script02_1_F013 [156.7200-163.8899]: Pass up what?  Its little fish
Ses05F_script02_1_M020 [163.5600-175.9470]: Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives
Ses05F_script02_1_M021 [175.9708-180.8800]: This is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. Yeah
Ses05F_script02_1_F014 [179.7833-186.4000]: What are you so excited about?  I mean it's not--it's not rocket science we are talking about
Ses05F_script02_1_M022 [186.0900-187.7600]: Yeah they do.
Ses05F_script02_1_FXX0 [187.6931-188.3720]: Augie.
Ses05F_script02_1_M023 [188.2700-197.4900]: Okay
Ses05F_script02_1_M024 [197.5100-205.6607]: There's There's mystery here and magic.  A little bit of the unexplainable.  I can't understand how you could not be interested.
Ses05F_script02_1_F015 [205.7400-207.6622]: I am just not.
Ses05F_script02_1_M025 [207.2700-208.6900]: For real?
Ses05F_script02_1_F016 [208.1300-209.5400]: Yes.
Ses05F_script02_1_M026 [209.9800-221.0800]: I don't get it
Ses05F_script02_1_F017 [220.4000-231.3700]: Last year you also remember
Ses05F_script02_1_M027 [230.4400-232.3720]: We weren't in a good spot.
Ses05F_script02_1_F018 [232.1337-234.4600]: We didn't see them the first time either.
Ses05F_script02_1_M028 [234.1200-239.5800]: We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I got a great instinct for these things.
Ses05F_script02_1_M029 [239.6000-246.7166]: Look there
Ses05F_script02_1_M030 [246.7880-254.7300]: Oh
Ses05F_script02_1_M031 [254.7600-270.4256]: Somewhere out there
Ses05F_script02_1_M032 [270.4494-281.1720]: It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming.
Ses05F_script02_1_M033 [281.2197-310.2662]: They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind
Ses05F_script02_1_F019 [308.6100-310.7189]: That's the wind.
Ses05F_script02_1_M034 [310.9000-315.2200]: Well
Ses05F_script02_2_M000 [006.2100-010.0200]: Well
Ses05F_script02_2_F000 [009.5800-011.9629]: About what?
Ses05F_script02_2_M001 [011.2611-014.0100]: What I was just saying.
Ses05F_script02_2_F001 [013.4666-015.6200]: It's ridiculous.
Ses05F_script02_2_M002 [015.0400-021.0520]: It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
Ses05F_script02_2_F002 [019.8700-025.7100]: It's PR
Ses05F_script02_2_M003 [025.2700-027.5000]: I am not the only one
Ses05F_script02_2_F003 [026.9700-038.3700]: Yeah
Ses05F_script02_2_M004 [038.0200-041.0346]: Are we talking about the same thing?
Ses05F_script02_2_F004 [040.3329-043.8750]: I am sorry.  It's just fish to me.
Ses05F_script02_2_M005 [043.1064-049.6559]: Carla
Ses05F_script02_2_F005 [048.5866-054.2339]: God damn it
Ses05F_script02_2_M006 [053.5600-055.4702]: What's bugging you?
Ses05F_script02_2_F006 [056.4727-060.4492]: I just had a different idea of what this evening is going to look like.
Ses05F_script02_2_M007 [059.9814-070.8081]: There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunion arrives and they do their little fish thing.  And we say
Ses05F_script02_2_F007 [075.3192-079.2200]: For heaven's sake Augie
Ses05F_script02_2_M008 [078.8200-080.4319]: Why not?
Ses05F_script02_2_F008 [080.2800-083.9000]: We never do.  Have we ever?  We never have.
Ses05F_script02_2_M009 [083.5300-086.0000]: We miss them twice
Ses05F_script02_2_F009 [085.1800-088.2900]: Twice is every time we tried
Ses05F_script02_2_M010 [087.6497-089.3200]: Well We will see them this year.
Ses05F_script02_2_F010 [089.4541-107.1645]: No
Ses05F_script02_2_M011 [106.2289-108.5011]: I thought you wanted to see it.
Ses05F_script02_2_F011 [107.7994-113.8142]: I did
Ses05F_script02_2_M012 [114.7833-118.8934]: It's just fish
Ses05F_script02_2_F012 [117.7200-120.6645]: For heaven's sake
Ses05F_script02_2_M013 [120.1632-127.0803]: Okay
Ses05F_script02_2_M014 [127.1806-139.0736]: When you are on the phone with Marge
Ses05F_script02_2_M015 [139.1070-145.9937]: Right
Ses05F_script02_2_F013 [145.3100-157.0543]: Augie
Ses05F_script02_2_F014 [157.2548-181.3810]: We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing
Ses05F_script02_2_F015 [181.4813-192.0072]: And I remember thinking
Ses05F_script02_2_M016 [191.8300-197.3700]: Wait a minute
Ses05F_script02_2_F016 [197.7213-203.7028]: Dancing barefoot in the sand
Ses05F_script02_2_M017 [203.3018-214.6297]: It was in the car
Ses05F_script02_2_F017 [213.0412-219.0072]: I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things.
Ses05F_script02_2_M018 [218.1200-225.4899]: Okay
Ses05F_script02_2_F018 [225.3896-227.2275]: No.
Ses05F_script02_2_M019 [226.8933-229.0654]: You want me to go get some champagne?
Ses05F_script02_2_F019 [228.8315-230.6025]: No.
Ses05F_script02_2_M020 [230.1347-231.9200]: Take off our shoes?
Ses05F_script02_2_F020 [231.3376-232.8079]: No.

Ses05F_script02_2_F024 [247.6200-252.0554]: I want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out.
Ses05F_script02_2_M025 [251.1866-253.6928]: What.  Welcome to the human race.
Ses05F_script02_2_M026 [253.7262-270.2149]: You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I propose I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road
Ses05F_script02_2_M027 [270.2483-288.2782]: No
Ses05F_script02_2_M028 [288.3116-293.2200]: Because you know what Carla?  You know what you get?  This.
Ses05F_script02_2_F025 [292.7100-297.7349]: This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
Ses05F_script02_2_M029 [297.2700-298.9400]: Yes it is.

Ses05F_script02_2_M031 [308.5950-312.7386]: No
Ses05F_script02_2_F028 [312.8054-332.1197]: I mean it is just this 
Ses05F_script02_2_M032 [332.5875-336.5306]: Maybe if you are with somebody else too?

Ses05F_script02_2_M035 [374.2571-381.1073]: Actually
Ses05F_script02_2_F033 [380.7063-387.5566]: Good.  So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person.
Ses05F_script02_2_M036 [387.1700-393.8721]: I don't know.  Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here.

Ses05F_script02_2_M039 [413.0528-417.4700]: Are you still cold?  You still want to go home?
Ses05F_script02_2_F037 [418.3600-424.2471]: No
Ses05F_script02_2_M040 [428.1568-433.3362]: Shh
Ses05F_script02_2_F038 [434.0379-435.9426]: Or not.
Ses05F_script02_2_M041 [436.5441-438.3820]: Or not.
Ses05F_script03_1_M000 [004.3300-006.6700]: Good God.
Ses05F_script03_1_F000 [006.4800-008.7100]: You think it's them?
Ses05F_script03_1_M001 [008.2500-010.3400]: I wonder.
Ses05F_script03_1_F001 [009.9200-013.3500]: Freda is the only one who knows we're up here
Ses05F_script03_1_M002 [013.0900-014.9200]: It must be them then.
Ses05F_script03_1_F002 [014.4500-016.5800]: What will be do?
Ses05F_script03_1_M003 [015.8100-019.0400]: We're all right
Ses05F_script03_1_F003 [018.3800-020.5000]: Now and always my sweet.
Ses05F_script03_1_M004 [020.1600-022.2800]: I don't care then.
Ses05F_script03_1_F004 [021.9900-024.5700]: It was bound to happen sooner or later.
Ses05F_script03_1_M005 [024.1800-031.8800]: Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.
Ses05F_script03_1_F005 [031.2700-034.1300]: Oh
Ses05F_script03_1_M006 [033.1100-036.0600]: Oh
Ses05F_script03_1_F006 [035.2700-037.2800]: Behave exquisitely.
Ses05F_script03_1_M007 [036.4500-038.5400]: With the most perfect poise.
Ses05F_script03_1_F007 [037.8800-040.6500]: Yes
Ses05F_script03_1_M008 [039.5600-045.7600]: [LAUGHTER] Oh
Ses05F_script03_1_F008 [044.4400-050.1600]: Um... It's a pity that one can't stay this way forever.
Ses05F_script03_1_M009 [049.4500-051.7300]: Darling
Ses05F_script03_1_F009 [052.5500-055.7900]: Well
Ses05F_script03_1_F010 [058.4500-061.5600]: The whole business is really rather ridiculous.
Ses05F_script03_1_M010 [061.0800-064.1900]: Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing
Ses05F_script03_1_F011 [063.9400-066.0700]: Meaning exactly that.
Ses05F_script03_1_M011 [065.4500-073.6700]: What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God
Ses05F_script03_1_F012 [073.0900-075.2000]: Don't laugh at me; I'm serious.
Ses05F_script03_1_M012 [074.9200-078.2100]: You mustn't be serious my dear one
Ses05F_script03_1_F013 [077.7200-079.2100]: Who's they?
Ses05F_script03_1_M013 [078.7300-093.5400]: All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything
Ses05F_script03_1_F014 [093.1300-096.2900]: Well
Ses05F_script03_1_M014 [095.5500-099.3800]: Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright [LAUGHTER].
Ses05F_script03_1_F015 [098.8500-103.9600]: Well
Ses05F_script03_1_F016 [107.1500-109.7200]: How long will it last
Ses05F_script03_1_M015 [109.2300-110.7500]: Who knows?
Ses05F_script03_1_F017 [111.1100-113.9100]: Well
Ses05F_script03_1_M016 [113.3400-117.4100]: No
Ses05F_script03_1_F018 [116.8500-119.4600]: Oh
Ses05F_script03_1_M017 [118.5800-121.0700]: It all depends on how well we played.
Ses05F_script03_1_F019 [120.8300-124.2900]: Well
Ses05F_script03_1_M018 [123.7400-125.9200]: Yes
Ses05F_script03_1_F020 [125.7200-128.1500]: Well
Ses05F_script03_1_M019 [127.4300-133.5400]: No
Ses05F_script03_1_F021 [133.3800-136.5800]: My dear
Ses05F_script03_1_M020 [135.7500-145.3400]: no
Ses05F_script03_1_M021 [145.3500-154.3300]: enjoy the party as long as we can like very little quite idiotic schoolchildren. [garbage] Let's savor the delight of the moment.
Ses05F_script03_1_M022 [154.3400-161.0400]: Darling
Ses05F_script03_1_F022 [160.0200-163.2000]: Elliot
Ses05F_script03_1_M023 [162.4100-173.9600]: I don't mind what you do
Ses05F_script03_1_F023 [173.6100-179.6200]: Oh
Ses05F_script03_1_M024 [179.0800-183.2400]: Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
Ses05F_script03_1_F024 [182.9400-184.8800]: Which particular one?
Ses05F_script03_1_M025 [184.3400-189.2300]: The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.
Ses05F_script03_1_F025 [188.4100-194.5200]: Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.
Ses05F_script03_1_M026 [193.7500-196.3700]: Horrible thing
Ses05F_script03_1_F026 [195.4100-200.4800]: I know.  You threw him out the window into the canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
Ses05F_script03_1_M027 [200.1400-202.1000]: How long did that row last?
Ses05F_script03_1_F027 [201.7900-204.8800]: It went on intermittently for days.
Ses05F_script03_1_M028 [204.5800-211.5500]: The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.
Ses05F_script03_1_F028 [209.5400-213.8800]: Uh- It burned all the towels in the bathroom
Ses05F_script03_1_M029 [212.8200-216.9500]: Oh
Ses05F_script03_1_F029 [216.4200-218.8000]: That was the first time you ever hit me.
Ses05F_script03_1_M030 [218.4700-220.6200]: Oh
Ses05F_script03_1_F030 [220.7100-227.1200]: And then the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.
Ses05F_script03_1_M031 [226.4900-229.4500]: [LAUGHTER] I shall never forget his face.
Ses05F_script03_1_F031 [227.9400-232.6500]: Oh
Ses05F_script03_1_M032 [230.6100-233.3200]: Oh
Ses05F_script03_1_F032 [232.6900-234.2200]: And very much sillier.
Ses05F_script03_1_M033 [234.0400-242.0500]: Oh
Ses05F_script03_1_F033 [241.6700-243.4048]: You knew there was nothing.
Ses05F_script03_2_M000 [004.6500-010.1500]: As a matter of fact
Ses05F_script03_2_F000 [010.0461-013.3500]: You knew there was nothing in that.
Ses05F_script03_2_M001 [012.7900-016.2700]: I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him.
Ses05F_script03_2_F001 [015.6000-018.0200]: Only a trivial little broach.
Ses05F_script03_2_M002 [017.3100-021.4900]: I remember it well
Ses05F_script03_2_F002 [020.0400-023.7100]: No
Ses05F_script03_2_M003 [023.1100-026.7900]: You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses05F_script03_2_F003 [026.4100-029.5300]: You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.
Ses05F_script03_2_M004 [029.0900-032.5800]: You must admit that he was in love with you
Ses05F_script03_2_F004 [031.9500-034.5400]: maybe just a little
Ses05F_script03_2_M005 [034.0800-036.9900]: You let him kiss you.  You said you did.
Ses05F_script03_2_F005 [036.6100-038.2200]: And what of it?
Ses05F_script03_2_M006 [037.9500-039.0500]: What of it?
Ses05F_script03_2_F006 [038.7800-042.6200]: Well
Ses05F_script03_2_M007 [041.7400-043.6700]: What about me?
Ses05F_script03_2_F007 [043.1200-047.7100]: Well
Ses05F_script03_2_M008 [047.0600-049.8000]: Well
Ses05F_script03_2_F008 [048.9800-054.0200]: I'm growing quite tired and bored of this conversation.
Ses05F_script03_2_M009 [053.5900-058.3400]: So am I
Ses05F_script03_2_F009 [057.9400-059.6100]: No.
Ses05F_script03_2_M010 [059.0800-061.5500]: I'll have a little I think.
Ses05F_script03_2_F010 [061.2300-064.7300]: I don't see why you want any.  You've already had three glasses.
Ses05F_script03_2_M011 [064.2400-067.9200]: No particular reason
Ses05F_script03_2_F011 [067.3400-070.7900]: Well
Ses05F_script03_2_M012 [070.3500-076.4200]: You can hardly call three liqueur glasses of brandy in a whole evening going on and on.
Ses05F_script03_2_F012 [075.7800-078.1600]: It's becoming a habit with you.
Ses05F_script03_2_M013 [077.6600-082.9300]: You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment.
Ses05F_script03_2_F013 [085.3600-087.4500]: Don't be so stupid.
Ses05F_script03_2_M014 [086.6900-088.5300]: Really
Ses05F_script03_2_M015 [094.7900-097.2800]: Going out somewhere
Ses05F_script03_2_F014 [096.4700-099.7700]: Just making myself fascinating for you.
Ses05F_script03_2_M016 [099.4100-102.2800]: Oh
Ses05F_script03_2_F015 [107.3500-111.3800]: It's the woman's job to allure the man.  Why don't you watch me for a moment?
Ses05F_script03_2_M017 [110.4300-113.4500]: As a matter of fact
Ses05F_script03_2_F016 [113.0800-114.9000]: No
Ses05F_script03_2_M018 [113.9600-115.7500]: Oh
Ses05F_script03_2_F017 [115.8200-117.9700]: Oh
Ses05F_script03_2_M019 [117.3600-122.2000]: It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
Ses05F_script03_2_F018 [121.2500-124.3900]: Um
Ses05F_script03_2_M020 [123.5500-125.9900]: Well
Ses05F_script03_2_F019 [125.2100-127.4000]: adder don't snap
Ses05F_script03_2_M021 [126.8700-129.9500]: Nonsense
Ses05F_script03_2_F020 [129.2800-130.4900]: They sting.
Ses05F_script03_2_M022 [129.9700-131.0500]: They snap.
Ses05F_script03_2_F021 [130.5900-134.5300]: I don't care if they bark and roll around like hoops
Ses05F_script03_2_M023 [134.0000-135.4100]: [BREATHING]
Ses05F_script03_2_M024 [138.1300-141.2500]: Did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?
Ses05F_script03_2_F022 [140.4600-142.3600]: Yes
Ses05F_script03_2_M025 [141.8700-144.8400]: I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.
Ses05F_script03_2_F023 [143.8800-145.3600]: Mind your own business.
Ses05F_script03_2_M026 [145.1100-150.4100]: You must have a riotous time
Ses05F_script03_2_F024 [149.6300-154.8300]: Oh dear
Ses05F_script03_2_M027 [154.0300-156.7300]: I'm not the least bit drunk.
Ses05F_script03_2_M028 [158.2400-166.4800]: I think I mentioned once before that I had only three-minute liqueur glasses of brandy the entire evening long.  A child of two could not be drunk on that.
Ses05F_script03_2_F025 [165.6600-170.5100]: Oh no
Ses05F_script03_2_M029 [169.6000-174.0600]: Oh
Ses05F_script03_2_F026 [172.4300-176.4800]: Oh
Ses05F_script03_2_M030 [175.1600-180.8800]: Oh
Ses05F_script03_2_F027 [180.5200-183.5700]: Not very funny
Ses05F_script03_2_M031 [182.5900-185.7400]: Oh
Ses05F_script03_2_F028 [186.3800-187.8500]: Ugh.
Ses05F_script03_2_M032 [187.3700-189.4400]: You better turn that off I think.
Ses05F_script03_2_F029 [189.1200-190.5400]: Why?
Ses05F_script03_2_M033 [190.2100-193.1600]: It's very late and it will disturb the people upstairs.
Ses05F_script03_2_F030 [192.4000-195.7400]: There aren't any people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.
Ses05F_script03_2_M034 [195.0600-197.7400]: Well
Ses05F_script03_2_F031 [196.8000-198.8600]: They're away in Tunis.
Ses05F_script03_2_M035 [198.0500-201.0900]: It is not time of year for Tunis.
Ses05F_script03_2_F032 [201.5500-203.7200]: Turn it on again.
Ses05F_script03_2_M036 [202.6100-204.4200]: I'll do no such thing.
Ses05F_script03_2_F033 [204.7900-210.1400]: Fine
Ses05F_script03_2_M037 [209.6100-212.6900]: Turn it off.  It is driving me mad.
Ses05F_script03_2_F034 [212.2200-215.0500]: Well
Ses05F_script03_2_M038 [214.3400-215.9600]: Turn it off.
Ses05F_script03_2_F035 [215.0800-219.1200]: You really do need to develop uh a clearer head.
Ses05F_script03_2_M039 [218.1400-219.8200]: Turn it off.
Ses05F_script03_2_F036 [219.3900-221.6700]: I- I hate you.
Ses05F_script03_2_M040 [220.9900-223.7200]: Amanda-- Listen- Listen-
Ses05F_script03_2_F037 [221.7100-222.9400]: I hate you.
Ses05F_script03_2_F038 [223.0100-229.8600]: No
Ses05F_script03_2_M041 [229.1600-231.8700]: Very music- amusing indeed.
Ses05F_script03_2_F039 [231.3600-237.4200]: Yeah
Ses05F_script03_2_M042 [236.1100-240.2700]: You are a vile tempered
Ses05F_script03_2_F040 [239.8400-247.1100]: Oh
Ses05F_script03_2_M043 [246.5500-256.4300]: Shut up
Ses05F_script03_2_F041 [248.5500-252.2800]: Beast; brute; cad; whore
Ses05M_impro01_F000 [003.9419-005.5500]: Can I help you?
Ses05M_impro01_M000 [005.1900-009.7600]: Yes
Ses05M_impro01_F001 [009.7900-019.0800]: Oh
Ses05M_impro01_M001 [018.8700-023.2300]: What do you mean?  I filled out my forms and I rushed to get my I.D.
Ses05M_impro01_F002 [021.8200-025.7400]: Right
Ses05M_impro01_M002 [025.4600-026.9700]: The wrong form?
Ses05M_impro01_F003 [025.9700-028.7700]: Yeah.  So
Ses05M_impro01_M003 [027.5100-031.2200]: What's wrong about this form?  It says new I.D. on it.
Ses05M_impro01_F004 [030.5800-037.7100]: No
Ses05M_impro01_M004 [036.6600-040.1800]: What's the difference?  What's the difference between that form and this form?
Ses05M_impro01_F005 [039.6500-042.4300]: Sir
Ses05M_impro01_M005 [042.0100-045.6200]: I'm not getting a -- well
Ses05M_impro01_F006 [045.1800-055.9300]: No
Ses05M_impro01_M006 [051.9500-052.9600]: yeah.
Ses05M_impro01_M007 [053.0100-054.0700]: right.
Ses05M_impro01_M008 [055.5000-061.3400]: Well then
Ses05M_impro01_F007 [060.2600-063.4300]: I don't know.  I don't know who told you.  It wasn't me.
Ses05M_impro01_M009 [062.9300-068.2100]: Well
Ses05M_impro01_F008 [066.1000-070.3800]: You- You can ask her if you want
Ses05M_impro01_M010 [070.0300-077.8600]: This is ridiculous.  I've been here for forty five minutes. Just standing in this one line. I took fifteen minutes to fill out that form.
Ses05M_impro01_F009 [073.0300-074.4200]: I know.
Ses05M_impro01_F010 [074.4300-076.7300]: Sir
Ses05M_impro01_M011 [077.8700-080.9800]: Do you know how long it's gonna take me to start all over and fill out the new form?
Ses05M_impro01_F011 [077.8100-080.1400]: You can waist as much as you want
Ses05M_impro01_F012 [080.1500-083.7500]: Yeah.  I know it's gonna take a minute.  But you-- so you might as well get started now.
Ses05M_impro01_M012 [083.5200-086.3200]: Might as well get started now? but Just take this one.
Ses05M_impro01_F013 [085.8300-089.2300]: I can't take this one
Ses05M_impro01_M013 [087.4100-098.7300]: Why can't we just -- you know what?  How about if we just pretend that I'm getting a -- renewing my California I.D. and we just don't tell anybody -- That I'm getting a new one from a different state?

Ses05M_impro01_F015 [097.6000-103.3300]: There is nothing I can do about it.  You need to take this other form and fill it out and go stand in the other line.
Ses05M_impro01_M014 [102.6700-114.3100]: Come on!  You know -- you can't just take -- make a little exception to the rule?  I know that you guys make exceptions.  I see -- you know

Ses05M_impro07_M039 [164.0100-172.3900]: And yeah
Ses05M_impro07_F040 [171.1600-172.6900]: the way to do it.
Ses05M_impro07_M040 [172.4300-179.9000]: Yeah
Ses05M_impro07_F041 [173.6400-175.8500]: Wow
Ses05M_impro07_FXX2 [179.0688-179.7402]: Right.
Ses05M_impro07_M041 [179.9100-184.0100]: It's just you know a dream come true.  How could you not be excited about a dream come true?
Ses05M_impro07_F042 [183.4500-188.4300]: You're gonna be so busy
Ses05M_impro07_M042 [185.5500-187.4900]: Oh I know
Ses05M_impro07_M043 [187.5600-192.3900]: But I'm so looking forward to being so busy. You know what I mean?  It's the kind of busy you've got to love
Ses05M_impro07_FXX3 [189.4691-190.5432]: Oh good.
Ses05M_impro07_F043 [191.8400-193.3900]: Oh totally.
Ses05M_impro07_M044 [192.4400-198.0700]: Because you're doing something you love.  That's the kind of busy you want.  I want to be able to do that for the rest of my life.  Be that kind of busy.
Ses05M_impro07_F044 [197.6100-201.4300]: All right.  Wow.  So exciting.
Ses05M_impro07_M045 [200.4800-205.3900]: I had to tell you right away.  I knew you'd be excited.
Ses05M_impro07_M046 [205.6300-207.0500]: We'll have fun.
Ses05M_impro07_F045 [206.7100-209.2800]: Yeah.  We'll have so much fun.
Ses05M_impro07_M047 [208.6000-212.1100]: Great.  Okay.
Ses05M_impro07_F046 [211.6700-213.3300]: cool
Ses05M_script01_1_F000 [006.0700-010.2900]: What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.
Ses05M_script01_1_M000 [009.6400-011.4400]: He saw it.
Ses05M_script01_1_F001 [010.9500-016.9600]: When?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.  How could he have seen it?
Ses05M_script01_1_M001 [016.5700-018.6700]: He was out here when it broke.
Ses05M_script01_1_F002 [018.2800-019.8700]: When?
Ses05M_script01_1_M002 [019.5300-028.2000]: I don't know
Ses05M_script01_1_F003 [028.1500-031.4400]: What was he doing out here at four in the morning?
Ses05M_script01_1_M003 [030.9600-037.3000]: I don't know
Ses05M_script01_1_F004 [036.9600-039.1800]: Did you talk to him?
Ses05M_script01_1_M004 [039.0200-043.0800]: No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.
Ses05M_script01_1_F005 [043.6300-045.3000]: He cried hard?
Ses05M_script01_1_M005 [044.9800-047.9600]: I could hear him right through the floor in my room.
Ses05M_script01_1_F006 [048.9500-058.8400]: What was he doing out there at that hour?  He's getting just like after Larry died
Ses05M_script01_1_M006 [058.4400-060.4100]: I guess he is.
Ses05M_script01_1_F007 [060.8800-063.5600]: What's the meaning of that?
Ses05M_script01_1_M007 [063.6700-069.0800]: I don't know the meaning of it
Ses05M_script01_1_F008 [068.6900-070.1200]: What?
Ses05M_script01_1_M008 [069.4500-073.9100]: Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.
Ses05M_script01_1_F009 [073.0000-075.0400]: What do you mean dishonest?
Ses05M_script01_1_M009 [074.4200-081.9000]: You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?
Ses05M_script01_1_F010 [081.4400-085.3200]: What do you want to do
Ses05M_script01_1_M010 [084.6800-092.0700]: I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore.
Ses05M_script01_1_M011 [092.0800-103.1400]: Why should he dream about him
Ses05M_script01_1_F011 [102.3700-104.4100]: You can't say that to him.
Ses05M_script01_1_M012 [103.5200-106.0500]: We have to say it to him.
Ses05M_script01_1_F012 [106.3200-108.9500]: how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?
Ses05M_script01_1_M013 [108.5600-114.2800]: For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane!
Ses05M_script01_1_F013 [113.4600-123.7900]: To you it is and to me
Ses05M_script01_1_M014 [124.9500-128.5500]: Sit down
Ses05M_script01_1_F014 [127.6500-134.3100]: The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up
Ses05M_script01_1_M015 [132.7200-140.2200]: All right.  All right
Ses05M_script01_1_F015 [139.5700-141.3300]: Why?
Ses05M_script01_1_M016 [141.7100-143.1500]: You know.
Ses05M_script01_1_F016 [142.8900-145.9400]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1_M017 [146.8900-149.7500]: I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses05M_script01_1_F017 [150.8000-153.1900]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1_M018 [152.6700-154.7700]: It's not just my business.
Ses05M_script01_1_F018 [154.3400-158.1600]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1_M019 [157.4900-159.7500]: So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it?
Ses05M_script01_1_F019 [159.0100-161.6200]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1_M020 [161.1300-163.9200]: Oh
Ses05M_script01_1_F020 [163.3700-165.1900]: I'm just saying.
Ses05M_script01_1_M021 [164.3800-170.8100]: You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God.
Ses05M_script01_1_M022 [172.5200-181.0800]: Isn't it your business
Ses05M_script01_1_F021 [180.1600-183.4700]: I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean
Ses05M_script01_1_M023 [182.7800-185.0100]: She is not Larry's girl!
Ses05M_script01_1_F022 [184.5000-199.5700]: From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now
Ses05M_script01_1_M024 [200.3900-210.4000]: I don't know why it is but everytime I reach out for something I- that I want
Ses05M_script01_1_F023 [209.7700-213.1700]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1_M025 [211.4400-213.4600]: To hell with that!
Ses05M_script01_1_F024 [213.2400-215.8200]: Have you asked Annie yet?
Ses05M_script01_1_M026 [215.8500-219.2300]: I wanted to get this taken care of first.
Ses05M_script01_1_F025 [219.0900-225.5000]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1_M027 [225.4700-240.2700]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1_F026 [240.4800-244.0200]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1_M028 [243.6100-246.6300]: So what?  I'm not fast with women.
Ses05M_script01_1_F027 [246.0600-248.9800]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1_M029 [248.5400-250.4800]: Because it is.
Ses05M_script01_1_F028 [250.0900-255.5800]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1_M030 [255.4806-264.7700]: I know her best
Ses05M_script01_1_F029 [263.7700-282.0200]: No.  I don't want a -- look
Ses05M_script01_1_M031 [284.7400-287.2700]: All right then
Ses05M_script01_1_F030 [287.4000-289.7200]: Just give it some more thought.
Ses05M_script01_1_M032 [289.7000-301.7700]: I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited
Ses05M_script01_1_M033 [302.0800-306.7100]: But if that can't happen
Ses05M_script01_1_F031 [306.2900-308.3000]: What the hell is this?
Ses05M_script01_1_M034 [307.8300-312.0400]: I'll get out.  I'll go get married and live someplace else.  I don't know
Ses05M_script01_1_F032 [311.6600-313.4200]: Are you crazy?
Ses05M_script01_1_M035 [313.0100-318.0700]: I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.
Ses05M_script01_1_F033 [317.9200-323.0400]: What?  You mean?  Tell me something
Ses05M_script01_1_M036 [322.7500-325.0300]: Yes.  On this
Ses05M_script01_1_F034 [325.0600-327.2300]: You can't think like that.
Ses05M_script01_1_M037 [327.1500-331.0700]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1_F035 [330.7700-336.8900]: All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for
Ses05M_script01_1_M038 [335.8800-340.0500]: I know that
Ses05M_script01_1_F036 [339.5700-342.0300]: Just don't think that way.  Do you hear me?
Ses05M_script01_1_M039 [341.4800-344.0500]: I am thinking that way.
Ses05M_script01_1_F037 [346.2700-348.7900]: I don't understand you
Ses05M_script01_1_M040 [348.4300-353.6000]: No
Ses05M_script01_1_F038 [353.5200-356.0700]: Yeah
Ses05M_script01_1b_F000 [003.1063-008.8600]: What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M000 [008.5700-010.7100]: He saw it.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F001 [010.6000-013.7700]: What do you mean?  I was the first one up
Ses05M_script01_1b_M001 [013.3100-015.6700]: He was out here when it broke.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F002 [015.1200-017.0200]: When?
Ses05M_script01_1b_M002 [016.8300-024.8300]: About four this morning.  I heard it crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F003 [025.3400-028.8700]: What was he doing out here four in the morning?
Ses05M_script01_1b_M003 [029.6900-036.1900]: I don't know.  But after he saw it
Ses05M_script01_1b_F004 [035.9800-038.5900]: Did you talk to him?
Ses05M_script01_1b_M004 [038.2300-044.0600]: No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F005 [045.2500-055.0200]: He's dreaming about him again.  He's getting just like after Larry died. What's the meaning of that?
Ses05M_script01_1b_M005 [051.9400-062.9700]: Yes
Ses05M_script01_1b_F006 [062.4100-064.0300]: What?
Ses05M_script01_1b_M006 [063.9700-069.2100]: Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F007 [068.6400-070.8400]: What do you mean dishonest?
Ses05M_script01_1b_M007 [070.6300-079.2100]: You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F008 [078.8200-081.5800]: What are you gonna do
Ses05M_script01_1b_M008 [080.9300-087.5700]: I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time that he knows that nobody else believes that Larry's alive. I mean
Ses05M_script01_1b_M009 [087.5900-098.9300]: Why shouldn't he dream about him
Ses05M_script01_1b_F009 [097.6800-100.1200]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1b_M010 [099.9400-106.1500]: For Gods sake
Ses05M_script01_1b_F010 [105.6000-110.7000]: To you it is and to me
Ses05M_script01_1b_F011 [111.4100-116.9200]: You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?
Ses05M_script01_1b_M011 [123.5800-126.8900]: Sit down
Ses05M_script01_1b_F012 [126.6200-133.8800]: The trouble is the God damn newspapers
Ses05M_script01_1b_M012 [133.4100-137.1991]: All right.  All right
Ses05M_script01_1b_M013 [138.6600-141.8900]: You know why I invited Annie
Ses05M_script01_1b_F013 [141.4600-143.2700]: Why?
Ses05M_script01_1b_M014 [142.9500-144.7200]: You know.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F014 [144.2100-148.0000]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1b_M015 [149.2500-152.2800]: I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F015 [153.0300-155.1100]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1b_M016 [154.6800-157.2100]: You know it's not just my business.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F016 [156.3700-159.7600]: What do you want me to do?  I mean
Ses05M_script01_1b_M017 [159.1600-161.6400]: So it's all right then?  I should just go ahead with it?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F017 [161.2200-164.7700]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1b_M018 [164.1200-170.4900]: So it isn't just my business?  You infuriate me sometime
Ses05M_script01_1b_M019 [170.5000-179.7700]: Isn't it your business
Ses05M_script01_1b_F018 [178.7900-182.6000]: I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean
Ses05M_script01_1b_M020 [181.4600-184.0500]: She's not Larry's girl.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F019 [183.5300-189.6200]: As far as your father is concerned
Ses05M_script01_1b_F020 [189.9900-196.5100]: Now
Ses05M_script01_1b_M021 [199.0900-208.5200]: I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something that I want
Ses05M_script01_1b_F021 [208.1400-211.3300]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1b_M022 [210.2500-212.4400]: what to hell with that!
Ses05M_script01_1b_F022 [212.3200-214.4800]: Have you asked Annie yet?
Ses05M_script01_1b_M023 [214.6600-217.5000]: I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F023 [217.3500-221.8500]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1b_M024 [221.3600-229.1700]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1b_M025 [229.2200-235.6200]: I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with dad
Ses05M_script01_1b_F024 [235.4900-239.0700]: The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M026 [238.5200-241.8500]: So what
Ses05M_script01_1b_F025 [242.2800-245.1700]: I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M027 [244.7500-246.8800]: Because it is.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F026 [246.7800-253.8500]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1b_M028 [253.5500-258.0900]: [garbage] I don't know.  It's just
Ses05M_script01_1b_M029 [258.3100-268.9800]: she's who I know best. I know her since I- I was a kid I grew up with her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days
Ses05M_script01_1b_F027 [268.1700-278.6500]: No I don't want a-  Your father thinks he's coming back
Ses05M_script01_1b_F028 [279.1400-286.7100]: Now
Ses05M_script01_1b_M030 [288.4600-290.8200]: All right then
Ses05M_script01_1b_F029 [290.4900-293.1400]: Just give it some more thought.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M031 [293.1400-304.3600]: I've given it three years of thought.  I had hoped if I waited
Ses05M_script01_1b_M032 [304.7100-309.5800]: But if that can't happen then I'll just get out.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F030 [309.5400-311.6300]: What the hell is this?
Ses05M_script01_1b_M033 [311.0400-316.8600]: I'll get out.  I'll go get married someplace else
Ses05M_script01_1b_F031 [315.7700-317.6700]: Are you crazy?
Ses05M_script01_1b_M034 [317.5600-322.1400]: I've been a good son for too long
Ses05M_script01_1b_F032 [321.6200-324.7600]: But you have a business here.  What the hell is this?
Ses05M_script01_1b_M035 [323.4300-326.7100]: The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F033 [326.0400-328.5600]: Must you be inspired?
Ses05M_script01_1b_M036 [327.0300-337.6500]: Yeah
Ses05M_script01_1b_M037 [337.7400-347.8900]: I'd like to build something that's my own.  And Annie is in the center of that.  Now
Ses05M_script01_1b_F034 [347.6800-350.2200]: You don't want to think like that.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M038 [350.4300-354.1500]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1b_F035 [353.8000-360.9800]: All right.  But don't think like that because what the hell did we work for
Ses05M_script01_1b_M039 [360.7800-366.1200]: I know that
Ses05M_script01_1b_F036 [365.5200-367.8500]: Don't think like that
Ses05M_script01_1b_M040 [367.0300-369.6377]: Well
Ses05M_script01_1b_F037 [370.8700-373.0100]: I don't understand you
Ses05M_script01_1b_M041 [372.5900-377.3700]: No
Ses05M_script01_1b_F038 [377.1300-379.7800]: Yeah
Ses05M_script01_2_F000 [004.9869-008.2400]: Why did you invite her here?
Ses05M_script01_2_M000 [008.1900-010.6800]: Why does that bother you?
Ses05M_script01_2_F001 [010.2600-014.0100]: She's been in New York three and a half years
Ses05M_script01_2_M001 [013.8600-019.4000]: Well
Ses05M_script01_2_F002 [018.5100-021.4600]: Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
Ses05M_script01_2_M002 [021.0500-031.0600]: What are you talking about?  He grew up next to the girl his whole life
Ses05M_script01_2_F003 [031.3200-033.7300]: He's not going to marry her.
Ses05M_script01_2_M003 [033.7900-037.1100]: Why do you think he's even thinking that?
Ses05M_script01_2_F004 [036.3900-038.8800]: He's got that about it.
Ses05M_script01_2_M004 [039.0300-042.4100]: Well
Ses05M_script01_2_F005 [042.2600-044.6300]: What's going on here
Ses05M_script01_2_M005 [044.3100-047.6800]: Now listen.
Ses05M_script01_2_F006 [048.2800-052.2300]: No.  She's not his girl
Ses05M_script01_2_M006 [051.8100-055.4500]: You don't know.  You can't read her mind.
Ses05M_script01_2_F007 [055.2600-063.1900]: Then why is she still single? I mean
Ses05M_script01_2_M007 [062.7700-066.1700]: How do you know why she's waited?
Ses05M_script01_2_F008 [066.3400-075.7300]: Because she knows what I know
Ses05M_script01_2_M008 [075.0600-079.5000]: Look
Ses05M_script01_2_F009 [079.1100-087.4600]: Nobody in this house dares takes her faith away
Ses05M_script01_2_M009 [086.8400-089.6500]: Well
Ses05M_script01_2_F010 [088.4100-098.0100]: I want you to pretend like he's coming back.  Both of you
Ses05M_script01_2_M010 [097.5100-099.0400]: But Kate?
Ses05M_script01_2_F011 [098.5100-105.2000]: No
Ses05M_script01_2_F012 [105.2400-112.1600]: But why did that happen the very night she came back?  She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it.
Ses05M_script01_2_M011 [111.8200-113.9300]: Calm yourself.
Ses05M_script01_2_F013 [114.0600-117.5300]: Believe with me
Ses05M_script01_2_M012 [116.9800-119.2100]: Calm yourself.
Ses05M_script01_2_F014 [118.6100-123.1500]: Only last week a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself.
Ses05M_script01_2_M013 [122.6900-124.7200]: All right.  All right.
Ses05M_script01_2_F015 [123.4600-126.4400]: You above all have got to believe.
Ses05M_script01_2_M014 [126.8900-130.4200]: What do you mean
Ses05M_script01_2_F016 [130.5300-133.1800]: Just don't stop believing.
Ses05M_script01_2_M015 [132.8400-136.2200]: What's that suppose to mean
Ses05M_script01_2_F017 [135.4100-136.9000]: I can't help it.
Ses05M_script01_2_M016 [136.6000-140.5800]: What have I got to hide
Ses05M_script01_3_F000 [003.3400-006.2900]: You're the only one I know who loves his parents.
Ses05M_script01_3_M000 [006.2181-010.4500]: I know.  It's going out of style
Ses05M_script01_3_F001 [010.1700-017.4600]: It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet.
Ses05M_script01_3_M001 [017.2600-020.2500]: So
Ses05M_script01_3_F002 [019.9600-024.4800]: No.  But I'm not going to stay.
Ses05M_script01_3_M002 [025.2200-026.9300]: Why?
Ses05M_script01_3_F003 [026.7600-030.4900]: Well
Ses05M_script01_3_M003 [030.1200-031.4900]: Well-
Ses05M_script01_3_F004 [030.5400-036.6900]: You saw that.  And well you've been --
Ses05M_script01_3_M004 [037.4600-038.6700]: What?
Ses05M_script01_3_F005 [039.8000-043.1700]: You've been sort of embarrassed since I got here.
Ses05M_script01_3_M005 [043.9700-053.4600]: Well
Ses05M_script01_3_F006 [053.5800-057.1300]: I figured they would
Ses05M_script01_3_M006 [057.7800-059.7400]: How did you know?
Ses05M_script01_3_F007 [059.5600-064.7100]: Well
Ses05M_script01_3_M007 [066.9800-078.5900]: Well
Ses05M_script01_3_F008 [079.7400-082.1800]: Yes
Ses05M_script01_3_M008 [082.5300-097.9500]: Annie
Ses05M_script01_3_M009 [098.1400-112.8500]: I don't know what to say.  I have no imagination.  That's all I have to say to you.  God
Ses05M_script01_3_M010 [113.0300-124.1900]: You feel it's wrong here
Ses05M_script01_3_F009 [123.0700-126.1400]: Oh
Ses05M_script01_3_M011 [127.0100-131.6100]: So he's gone forever then?  You sure?
Ses05M_script01_3_F010 [131.8600-134.5300]: I almost got married two years ago.
Ses05M_script01_3_M012 [135.0800-137.0700]: Why didn't you?
Ses05M_script01_3_F011 [137.3100-139.5600]: You started to write me.
Ses05M_script01_3_M013 [139.4800-142.5800]: You felt something that far back?
Ses05M_script01_3_F012 [141.9300-143.4600]: Everyday since.
Ses05M_script01_3_M014 [143.7700-147.1600]: Annie
Ses05M_script01_3_F013 [146.7600-154.1600]: Well
Ses05M_script01_3_M015 [153.3900-157.5500]: Give me a kiss
Ses05M_script01_3_M016 [158.4500-164.7700]: oh
Ses05M_script01_3_F014 [163.4600-171.0900]: I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've sat around wondering if I was crazy for thinking of you.
Ses05M_script01_3_M017 [170.1300-175.0000]: Oh
Ses05M_script01_3_F015 [174.5800-177.1800]: Not like that you're not.
Ses05M_script01_3_M018 [177.1800-179.1100]: I kissed you.
Ses05M_script01_3_F016 [178.8000-186.3304]: Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you
Ses05M_script01_3_M019 [187.5700-192.0500]: Lets go for a ride.  I I- I want to be alone with you.
Ses05M_script01_3_F017 [190.8800-193.2400]: No.  Chris
Ses05M_script01_3_M020 [192.9000-195.7700]: No
Ses05M_script01_3_F018 [196.9800-198.9700]: You have to tell me.
Ses05M_script01_3_F019 [200.5200-204.7000]: Even in your letters there was something ashamed.
Ses05M_script01_3_M021 [205.1700-210.6900]: Yeah
Ses05M_script01_3_F020 [211.1600-213.3700]: You have to tell me.
Ses05M_script01_3_M022 [214.2000-216.6400]: I don't I don't know where to start.
Ses05M_script01_3_F021 [216.9600-219.0581]: It wouldn't work like this.
Ses05M_script01_3_M023 [220.3200-224.2900]: It's so mixed up with so many other things.
Ses05M_script01_3_M024 [225.4600-229.8700]: You remember when I was overseas
Ses05M_script01_3_F022 [229.2700-230.9500]: Yeah
Ses05M_script01_3_M025 [231.5268-233.1245]: I lost them.
Ses05M_script01_3_F023 [234.0200-235.6400]: How many?
Ses05M_script01_3_M026 [236.3100-238.4200]: Just about all.
Ses05M_script01_3_M027 [241.8900-249.8300]: It- It takes time to toss something like that off
Ses05M_script01_3_M028 [250.5300-263.2400]: For instance
Ses05M_script01_3_M029 [263.4100-278.5700]: I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had.  They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.
Ses05M_script01_3_M030 [278.6600-291.3600]: I mean that exactly
Ses05M_script01_3_M031 [291.6400-308.2300]: Everything was being destroyed see
Ses05M_script01_3_M032 [308.7600-320.8700]: And and to see that again
Ses05M_script01_3_M033 [320.9400-336.4500]: It was and then I went home.  And it was incredible.  It didn't have any meaning there.
Ses05M_script01_3_M034 [336.5200-345.2700]: I mean
Ses05M_script01_3_M035 [346.3400-350.3400]: So I went back to work for my dad and that whole rat race again.
Ses05M_script01_3_M036 [360.8700-371.3900]: I felt what you said
Ses05M_script01_3_M037 [371.4300-383.6158]: It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys.  And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book
Ses05M_script01_3_M038 [383.6258-399.3100]: you can take those things out of the war
Ses05M_script01_3_M039 [403.0000-405.2800]: And I guess that included you.
Ses05M_script01_3_F024 [406.5000-409.1800]: Do you still feel like that?
Ses05M_script01_3_M040 [410.9900-413.4300]: I want you now
Ses05M_script01_3_F025 [413.8400-424.4000]: Because you can't feel like that anymore
Ses05M_script01_3_F026 [424.5800-430.9100]: And you father
Ses05M_script01_3_M041 [430.4700-432.3400]: Oh
Ses05M_script01_3_F027 [434.8300-437.7200]: [LAUGHTER] What will I do with a fortune?
Ses05M_script01_3_M042 [432.4000-435.1500]: Annie I am going to make you a fortune.
M: Oh [garbage]
Ses05M_script02_1_M000 [003.7900-024.8400]: What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  Oh
Ses05M_script02_1_F000 [024.6765-025.8200]: Fine.
Ses05M_script02_1_M001 [025.5200-040.6800]: What's that? Is that- Wait
Ses05M_script02_1_M002 [040.6900-056.7800]: This is great.  How are you doing?  Oh
Ses05M_script02_1_F001 [056.2900-058.1700]: What flashlight?
Ses05M_script02_1_M003 [057.5700-061.1400]: The flashlight.  The silver one.  There's only one
Ses05M_script02_1_F002 [060.7000-062.9100]: You mean our flashlight?
Ses05M_script02_1_M004 [062.9000-063.9700]: Well-
Ses05M_script02_1_F003 [063.6300-070.3400]: I mean
Ses05M_script02_1_M005 [070.0300-077.2800]: Oh
Ses05M_script02_1_M006 [077.3000-089.8100]: How could we have forgotten it? Well
Ses05M_script02_1_F004 [088.6600-089.7600]: Yes.
Ses05M_script02_1_M007 [090.3300-105.5200]: Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket
Ses05M_script02_1_M008 [105.5600-116.0900]: I can't believe I forgot.I'm like a little kid.  I'm surprised I made it out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh
Ses05M_script02_1_M009 [116.1000-122.9000]: Oh
Ses05M_script02_1_F005 [121.7500-123.0800]: I'm cold.
Ses05M_script02_1_M010 [122.9100-124.3900]: Do you want my jacket?
Ses05M_script02_1_F006 [124.0200-126.7100]: It's after eleven.  Let's just go home.
Ses05M_script02_1_M011 [126.4700-134.1400]: Are you kidding?  We just got here
Ses05M_script02_1_F007 [133.1400-135.3300]: There is no point in coming out here.
Ses05M_script02_1_M012 [134.6700-136.0000]: Right.
Ses05M_script02_1_F008 [135.6100-136.9100]: That's my point.
Ses05M_script02_1_M013 [136.1700-137.5600]: That's my point
Ses05M_script02_1_F009 [137.0300-138.4600]: So let's go.
Ses05M_script02_1_M014 [138.0100-143.6900]: Oh
Ses05M_script02_1_F010 [143.5200-145.4900]: Not particularly.
Ses05M_script02_1_M015 [145.0200-146.8500]: Why not?
Ses05M_script02_1_F011 [146.8900-148.7700]: I just don't.
Ses05M_script02_1_M016 [149.1200-150.6700]: Oh
Ses05M_script02_1_F012 [153.9000-155.1000]: it's stupid.
Ses05M_script02_1_M017 [154.6200-164.0679]: Honey
Ses05M_script02_1_M018 [164.0779-173.3600]: I mean
Ses05M_script02_1_F013 [172.8200-179.4200]: Pass what up?  It's It's just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.
Ses05M_script02_1_M019 [179.1600-185.5500]: Yeah
Ses05M_script02_1_M020 [185.5600-194.6549]: and all that about flopping around
Ses05M_script02_1_M021 [194.6649-201.6300]: I mean
Ses05M_script02_1_F014 [200.8700-207.0300]: What are you so excited about.  This isn't rocket science
Ses05M_script02_1_M022 [206.5600-208.2700]: Yeah
Ses05M_script02_1_F015 [207.6300-209.3300]: Augie.
Ses05M_script02_1_M023 [208.8900-227.0400]: All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs
Ses05M_script02_1_F016 [227.0200-228.7500]: I'm just not.
Ses05M_script02_1_M024 [228.5500-230.1800]: For real?
Ses05M_script02_1_F017 [229.5900-230.9400]: Yes.
Ses05M_script02_1_M025 [230.6100-245.0700]: I don't get it.  I mean
Ses05M_script02_1_F018 [243.5000-253.4100]: Well
Ses05M_script02_1_M026 [252.9300-254.8500]: We weren't in a good spot.
Ses05M_script02_1_F019 [254.6000-257.1800]: We didn't see them the first time either.
Ses05M_script02_1_M027 [256.6800-263.5500]: We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I've got a great sense for these things.
Ses05M_script02_1_M028 [270.5500-276.6800]: Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No
Ses05M_script02_1_M029 [276.8500-285.1000]: Oh
Ses05M_script02_1_M030 [285.1312-319.2700]: somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-
Ses05M_script02_1_M031 [321.5400-333.1800]: And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency
Ses05M_script02_1_M032 [333.1900-348.2400]: they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death. God
Ses05M_script02_1_F020 [347.3700-348.7200]: That's the wind.
Ses05M_script02_1_M033 [348.4000-353.2800]: Well
Ses05M_script02_2_M000 [004.1500-008.3200]: Well
Ses05M_script02_2_F000 [007.8200-009.4300]: About what?
Ses05M_script02_2_M001 [009.2900-011.5200]: What I was just saying.
Ses05M_script02_2_F001 [011.2000-012.6600]: It's ridiculous.
Ses05M_script02_2_M002 [012.6300-017.9200]: It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
Ses05M_script02_2_F002 [017.1200-023.4300]: It's P.R. somebody sold you a bill of goods that this magical thing would be happening on the beach.
Ses05M_script02_2_M003 [022.9600-025.4500]: I'm not the only one
Ses05M_script02_2_F003 [024.6500-035.7400]: Sure.  Everybody is told the same thing
Ses05M_script02_2_M004 [036.3400-038.5400]: Are we talking about the same thing?
Ses05M_script02_2_F004 [038.0000-041.5400]: I'm sorry.  It's just
Ses05M_script02_2_M005 [041.6000-050.7100]: uh
Ses05M_script02_2_F005 [050.0600-057.1200]: God damn it
Ses05M_script02_2_M006 [056.0900-058.1900]: What's bugging you then?
Ses05M_script02_2_F006 [057.8100-062.0700]: I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like.
Ses05M_script02_2_M007 [061.5600-071.6400]: It's not that complicated.  We come down here
Ses05M_script02_2_F007 [071.0300-076.1700]: For God's sake
Ses05M_script02_2_M008 [075.7300-077.2100]: Why not?
Ses05M_script02_2_F008 [077.3900-080.1500]: We We don't ever.  Have we ever?
Ses05M_script02_2_M009 [079.7700-082.9200]: We've missed them twice.  That's hardly ever.
Ses05M_script02_2_F009 [082.3800-084.8600]: Twice is every time we've tried
Ses05M_script02_2_M010 [084.1500-085.9900]: Well
Ses05M_script02_2_F010 [085.5100-102.0000]: No

Ses05M_script02_2_F012 [110.1400-118.0900]: I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.
Ses05M_script02_2_M013 [121.2400-130.2900]: I'm trying to work this backwards.  But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here.  Okay
Ses05M_script02_2_M014 [130.3158-152.0600]: you were fine on the phone call with Marge
Ses05M_script02_2_F013 [150.4300-182.3400]: Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.
Ses05M_script02_2_F014 [183.2400-193.3300]: And I remember thinking to myself
Ses05M_script02_2_M015 [194.6400-198.9500]: Wait a minute.  I've got it.
Ses05M_script02_2_F015 [201.2900-207.0300]: Dancing barefoot in the sand
Ses05M_script02_2_M016 [206.4500-217.6200]: It was in the car
Ses05M_script02_2_F016 [216.6100-222.9000]: I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something.
Ses05M_script02_2_M017 [222.5000-230.0600]: Okay.  All right No problem.  I totally understand. okey  um
Ses05M_script02_2_F017 [230.0000-231.3200]: No.
Ses05M_script02_2_M018 [231.5100-233.8500]: Do you want me to go get some champagne?
Ses05M_script02_2_F018 [233.4900-234.9800]: No.
Ses05M_script02_2_M019 [234.5700-236.1800]: Take off our shoes?
Ses05M_script02_2_F019 [235.4200-236.5400]: No.
Ses05M_script02_2_M020 [236.4400-239.7700]: What
Ses05M_script02_2_F020 [239.5200-241.3100]: [LAUGHTER] No.
Ses05M_script02_2_M021 [240.7000-246.8100]: Do you want to get married again?- What?  What
Ses05M_script02_2_FXX0 [242.9272-243.6001]: No.
Ses05M_script02_2_F021 [246.0500-247.2800]: No.

Ses05M_script02_2_M023 [248.8600-254.5800]: A poodle
Ses05M_script02_2_F023 [253.0700-257.3700]: I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.
Ses05M_script02_2_M024 [256.4200-270.4100]: Well
Ses05M_script02_2_M025 [270.4270-297.2000]: Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think
Ses05M_script02_2_M026 [297.2600-302.6900]: Because you know what you get
Ses05M_script02_2_F024 [302.3700-306.3200]: This?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
Ses05M_script02_2_M027 [305.9800-307.3100]: Yes
Ses05M_script02_2_F025 [306.9900-312.1983]: Sure
Ses05M_script02_2_M028 [312.0300-313.7020]: Right.
Ses05M_script02_2_F026 [313.8300-318.2969]: But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.
Ses05M_script02_2_M029 [318.3400-321.9900]: Now
Ses05M_script02_2_F027 [322.1100-332.1900]: This is just this.  I mean
Ses05M_script02_2_M030 [331.7400-334.0400]: I'm trying the best I can.
Ses05M_script02_2_F028 [333.6500-345.9600]: I know that
Ses05M_script02_2_F029 [346.9300-351.6200]: But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
Ses05M_script02_2_M031 [353.3600-356.9900]: Maybe if you're with somebody else
Ses05M_script02_2_F030 [356.8400-358.4200]: I didn't say that.
Ses05M_script02_2_M032 [358.0900-362.3500]: No
Ses05M_script02_2_F031 [362.3300-368.7200]: For heavens sake
Ses05M_script02_2_M033 [368.5200-370.1900]: Really?
Ses05M_script02_2_F032 [370.2900-381.7500]: Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean
Ses05M_script02_2_M034 [381.7787-389.3800]: Actually
Ses05M_script02_2_F033 [390.5400-394.5900]: Okay.  Well
Ses05M_script02_2_M035 [394.7600-400.7742]: I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean
Ses05M_script02_2_F034 [402.0482-411.2600]: Yes
Ses05M_script02_2_M036 [412.3500-416.0200]: Oh

Ses05M_script02_2_M037 [417.8700-420.0800]: Well
Ses05M_script02_2_F036 [419.2800-421.9500]: Well
Ses05M_script02_2_M038 [423.1700-427.8400]: Are you still cold?  Still want to go home?
Ses05M_script02_2_F037 [428.3000-441.7800]: No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie
Ses05M_script02_2_M039 [440.8400-447.4700]: Shh.  If we're really quiet
Ses05M_script02_2_F038 [448.6800-450.6900]: Or not.
Ses05M_script02_2_M040 [450.9519-453.2597]: Or not.
Ses05M_script03_1_M000 [003.1147-005.5100]: Oh Good God.
Ses05M_script03_1_F000 [005.1500-006.5000]: Do you think it's them?
Ses05M_script03_1_M001 [006.0800-007.8745]: I wonder.
Ses05M_script03_1_F001 [007.7000-011.1200]: what
Ses05M_script03_1_M002 [010.6800-012.8100]: Must be them then?
Ses05M_script03_1_F002 [012.3000-014.6700]: What do we do?
Ses05M_script03_1_M003 [014.0600-017.1100]: We're all right
Ses05M_script03_1_F003 [016.6700-018.9500]: Now and always
Ses05M_script03_1_M004 [018.4300-020.5800]: I don't care then.
Ses05M_script03_1_F004 [020.1800-022.9600]: It was bound to happen sooner or later.
Ses05M_script03_1_M005 [022.3800-031.0100]: Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.
Ses05M_script03_1_F005 [030.4200-033.0800]: Oh
Ses05M_script03_1_M006 [032.3100-035.2500]: Oh
Ses05M_script03_1_F006 [034.4000-036.3400]: Behave exquisitely.
Ses05M_script03_1_M007 [035.5600-038.0200]: With the worst- with the most perfect poise?
Ses05M_script03_1_F007 [037.5500-040.3200]: I shall probably do a Court Curtsey.
Ses05M_script03_1_M008 [039.4700-044.0700]: Uhh
Ses05M_script03_1_M009 [047.5400-051.4600]: things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy
Ses05M_script03_1_F008 [050.8400-053.4900]: What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.
Ses05M_script03_1_M010 [053.1200-055.3300]: Uhh
Ses05M_script03_1_F009 [054.6500-058.2700]: Well
Ses05M_script03_1_M011 [057.7200-061.1900]: Being that sacred and wonderful thing
Ses05M_script03_1_F010 [060.6600-062.3500]: Meaning just that.
Ses05M_script03_1_M012 [061.6400-072.3000]: Um What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my endless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God
Ses05M_script03_1_F011 [071.0600-074.0200]: Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.
Ses05M_script03_1_M013 [073.5200-077.2800]: You mustn't be serious
Ses05M_script03_1_F012 [077.2400-079.1900]: Who's they?
Ses05M_script03_1_M014 [078.4200-089.7222]: All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them
Ses05M_script03_1_M015 [089.7322-097.0000]: uh- the- Being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light.
Ses05M_script03_1_F013 [096.8500-099.8200]: If I laugh at everything
Ses05M_script03_1_M016 [099.5300-102.8200]: Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun all right.
Ses05M_script03_1_F014 [102.4900-107.4800]: Oh
Ses05M_script03_1_M017 [106.0400-108.5200]: [garbage] who knows?
Ses05M_script03_1_F015 [109.2600-112.9600]: Well
Ses05M_script03_1_M018 [112.2300-115.9200]: No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.
Ses05M_script03_1_F016 [115.4600-118.1900]: Oh
Ses05M_script03_1_M019 [117.3500-119.6100]: Well
Ses05M_script03_1_F017 [120.3800-124.4200]: What if one of us dies
Ses05M_script03_1_M020 [123.8200-126.8200]: Yes
Ses05M_script03_1_F018 [126.3900-128.8200]: That's rather serious
Ses05M_script03_1_M021 [128.0200-134.6200]: No
Ses05M_script03_1_F019 [134.0900-137.1300]: Darling
Ses05M_script03_1_M022 [136.2700-153.6584]: So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can
Ses05M_script03_1_M023 [153.6684-160.2300]: [garbage] Darling
Ses05M_script03_1_F020 [159.9200-162.7600]: Elliott
Ses05M_script03_1_M024 [162.4100-174.9900]: I don't care what you do.  See
Ses05M_script03_1_F021 [174.6500-181.0200]: Uhh
Ses05M_script03_1_M025 [180.8000-186.2300]: Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
Ses05M_script03_1_F022 [185.8500-187.9700]: Which particular one?
Ses05M_script03_1_M026 [187.7200-191.9800]: The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed.
Ses05M_script03_1_F023 [191.1700-196.9600]: Awe
Ses05M_script03_1_M027 [195.9200-198.3500]: Horrible thing.  I hated it.
Ses05M_script03_1_F024 [197.5500-203.6500]: I know you did.  You threw it out the window into the Canal below.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
Ses05M_script03_1_M028 [203.2500-205.7200]: How long did that roue last?
Ses05M_script03_1_F025 [205.1900-207.9700]: It went on intermittently for days.
Ses05M_script03_1_M029 [206.9300-213.8300]: Oh
Ses05M_script03_1_F026 [211.2000-216.1300]: Oh
Ses05M_script03_1_M030 [215.4000-220.7500]: [LAUGHTER] That was quit a rouser
Ses05M_script03_1_F027 [219.8600-221.8100]: That was the first time you hit me.
Ses05M_script03_1_M031 [221.1300-223.8300]: Oh
Ses05M_script03_1_F028 [223.8700-230.5500]: And then the manager came in and saw us all rolling all over the floor
Ses05M_script03_1_M032 [229.8800-233.0600]: I should never forget his face. [LAUGHTER]
Ses05M_script03_1_F029 [231.6400-234.9700]: How ridiculous
Ses05M_script03_1_M033 [234.1400-236.6600]: We were very much younger then.
Ses05M_script03_1_F030 [235.9100-237.9000]: Very much sillier.
Ses05M_script03_1_M034 [238.7300-245.3800]: Come to think of it
Ses05M_script03_1_F031 [245.0600-247.0439]: You knew there was nothing in that.
Ses05M_script03_2_M000 [004.3240-009.3400]: Come to think of it the real cause of that roue was Peter Burden.
Ses05M_script03_2_F000 [008.8100-010.9600]: Oh You knew there was nothing in that.
Ses05M_script03_2_M001 [010.4400-013.7100]: I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him.
Ses05M_script03_2_F001 [013.1300-015.5200]: Only a trivial little broach.
Ses05M_script03_2_M002 [015.0600-018.9800]: I remember it well
Ses05M_script03_2_F002 [017.7900-021.4300]: Not at all.  I quite like it.  I wear it often.
Ses05M_script03_2_M003 [021.1100-025.4000]: You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses05M_script03_2_F003 [024.9496-030.4600]: [garbage]
Ses05M_script03_2_M004 [029.7800-032.9700]: You must admit that he was in love with you. wasn't he?
Ses05M_script03_2_F004 [032.1200-035.5500]: Oh
Ses05M_script03_2_M005 [034.8500-037.6200]: He let him kiss you.  You said you did.
Ses05M_script03_2_F005 [037.1200-038.5800]: Well
Ses05M_script03_2_M006 [038.2400-039.8900]: what of it?
Ses05M_script03_2_F006 [039.2300-042.4900]: Well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.
Ses05M_script03_2_M007 [041.8900-043.7700]: What about me?
Ses05M_script03_2_F007 [043.2400-047.3100]: Well
Ses05M_script03_2_M008 [046.3500-049.2000]: Well
Ses05M_script03_2_F008 [048.6300-051.5000]: I'm getting very bored with this conversation.
Ses05M_script03_2_M009 [050.7000-052.9500]: Me
Ses05M_script03_2_M010 [054.1500-056.0400]: Do you want some brandy?
Ses05M_script03_2_F009 [055.6400-057.2800]: No thanks.
Ses05M_script03_2_M011 [057.2500-059.1300]: I think I'll have a little.
Ses05M_script03_2_F010 [058.9800-062.8400]: I don't see why you want it; you've already had two glasses.
Ses05M_script03_2_M012 [062.2700-065.9300]: No particular reason.  Besides
Ses05M_script03_2_F011 [065.4000-068.9800]: Well
Ses05M_script03_2_M013 [068.3600-077.7000]: You can hardly say- You can hardly call three little liquor glasses of brandy for the entire evening going on and on.
Ses05M_script03_2_F012 [077.0000-079.5900]: It's becoming a habit with you.
Ses05M_script03_2_M014 [078.8500-083.0000]: You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want me at the moment.
Ses05M_script03_2_F013 [082.2600-084.4600]: Don't be stupid.
Ses05M_script03_2_M015 [084.0600-086.0600]: Amanda
Ses05M_script03_2_F014 [085.0300-086.0700]: What?
Ses05M_script03_2_M016 [087.0900-092.7300]: Nothing.  Are you going out somewhere
Ses05M_script03_2_F015 [092.1900-094.9900]: Just making myself fascinating for you.
Ses05M_script03_2_M017 [094.5500-098.9600]: Um- Well
Ses05M_script03_2_F016 [098.5400-102.7200]: It's a woman's job to allure the man.  Watch me a moment
Ses05M_script03_2_M018 [101.8100-103.9800]: Oh
Ses05M_script03_2_F017 [103.3200-104.7400]: No
Ses05M_script03_2_M019 [104.0100-105.1900]: Yes
Ses05M_script03_2_F018 [104.8700-107.7200]: No
Ses05M_script03_2_M020 [107.9400-113.2900]: It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
Ses05M_script03_2_F019 [112.6000-116.1000]: hum
Ses05M_script03_2_M021 [115.3900-117.7900]: oh
Ses05M_script03_2_F020 [117.2700-119.5000]: Adders don't snap
Ses05M_script03_2_M022 [118.8300-122.3300]: Nonsense
Ses05M_script03_2_F021 [121.8400-123.0985]: They sting.
Ses05M_script03_2_M023 [122.3400-123.5900]: They snap.
Ses05M_script03_2_F022 [123.1085-127.6600]: Okay
Ses05M_script03_2_M024 [129.4400-136.1000]: So
Ses05M_script03_2_F023 [135.4000-137.2600]: Yes
Ses05M_script03_2_M025 [136.8800-141.2000]: You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then
Ses05M_script03_2_F024 [139.7100-142.3200]: [LAUGHTER] Mind your own business.
Ses05M_script03_2_M026 [141.9200-149.3500]: I'm sure you had a riotous time
Ses05M_script03_2_F025 [147.6300-151.3600]: You're quite insufferable.  I do imagine it's because you're drunk.
Ses05M_script03_2_M027 [150.7700-153.7600]: I am not the slightest bit drunk.
Ses05M_script03_2_F026 [153.0200-154.8600]: You always had a weak head.
Ses05M_script03_2_M028 [154.3900-162.3300]: I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.
Ses05M_script03_2_F027 [161.7500-166.2900]: Oh
Ses05M_script03_2_M029 [165.2600-169.8100]: Oh
Ses05M_script03_2_F028 [169.4400-172.3200]: Not- Would you shut up.
Ses05M_script03_2_M030 [172.0500-177.6500]: You know
Ses05M_script03_2_F029 [177.1200-180.3500]: You're not very funny
Ses05M_script03_2_M031 [179.6000-183.2400]: You know what?  That's a very good idea.  I think I will.
Ses05M_script03_2_M032 [186.8900-188.9900]: You better turn that off
Ses05M_script03_2_F030 [188.5200-190.4000]: Why?
Ses05M_script03_2_M033 [190.3300-193.9600]: Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs.
Ses05M_script03_2_F031 [193.7000-196.8500]: There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photography studio.
Ses05M_script03_2_M034 [196.1700-198.6600]: Well
Ses05M_script03_2_F032 [197.7600-199.5700]: They're away in Tunis.
Ses05M_script03_2_M035 [198.8600-201.7200]: This is no time of the year for Tunis.
Ses05M_script03_2_F033 [201.6300-203.6900]: Turn it on again
Ses05M_script03_2_M036 [203.0700-205.2300]: I do I shall do no such thing.
Ses05M_script03_2_F034 [205.1300-209.4100]: Very well.  If you have to be boorish and idiotic.
Ses05M_script03_2_M037 [210.8600-213.3600]: Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
Ses05M_script03_2_F035 [212.4400-215.4500]: You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
Ses05M_script03_2_M038 [214.7900-216.2300]: Turn it off!
Ses05M_script03_2_F036 [215.7200-219.0600]: Go away!  Go away!  I- I hate you.
Ses05M_script03_2_M039 [218.8300-221.3700]: Very amusing indeed.
Ses05M_script03_2_F037 [222.6300-227.9500]: You know what
Ses05M_script03_2_M040 [227.4800-230.8500]: Ja! Very funny.
Ses05M_script03_2_F038 [230.2800-236.8700]: Stop.  Would you just go away?  I mean
Ses05M_script03_2_M041 [236.5700-244.8300]: You are a vile tempered
Ses05M_script03_2_F039 [243.0400-246.3600]: This is the end! Do you understand me? This is the end.
Ses05M_script03_2_M042 [244.8400-246.5800]: Oh
Ses05M_script03_2_F040 [246.3700-248.7500]: Yes
Ses05M_script03_2_M043 [246.5900-248.8300]: [GARBAGE] No
Ses05M_script03_2_F041 [248.7600-257.3000]: You are a cruel fiend and I-I loath you.  I thank God I realized who you are before I decided to marry you again.  Oh my God
Ses05M_script03_2_M044 [255.8600-260.3300]: oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee.
Ses05M_script03_2_F042 [259.4500-260.4100]: Beast
Ses05M_script03_2_M045 [260.3400-266.3500]: You're a wicked little vampire.  And I pray to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live.
Ses05M_script03_2_F043 [260.4200-261.4300]: Brute
Ses05M_script03_2_F044 [261.9100-263.0700]: pig
