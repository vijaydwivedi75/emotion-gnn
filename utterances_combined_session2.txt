Ses02F_impro02_M004 [075.6898-078.5377]: It's not going to be the same.
Ses02F_impro02_M005 [079.4743-088.2594]: What if--maybe--what if

Ses02F_impro02_F009 [139.4718-143.5239]: You can just remember it for me.
Ses02F_impro02_M008 [144.2502-150.5386]: I don't know--I don't know--I don't know how--I don't know how this could even be possible for you--I--if I was--
Ses02F_impro02_F010 [148.5507-156.3682]: Well

Ses02F_impro02_M010 [177.9283-185.5164]: ...it would be so much better if we can--if we could stay together somehow.  You know--we could--we could do this together.
Ses02F_impro02_F012 [184.8857-191.1740]: I don't want you in danger.  And I don't want her in danger.
Ses02F_impro02_M011 [190.0061-194.4042]: I don't want you in danger.  Where are you going?  You're going over to war.
Ses02F_impro02_F013 [193.9264-207.0400]: I have no choice. There's nothing I can do.
M: Well--I mean--
Ses02F_impro02_M012 [208.8905-210.8151]: All right.
Ses02F_impro03_F000 [004.7324-008.7800]: Oh my God.  Guess what
Ses02F_impro03_M000 [006.2177-008.7208]: What?

Ses02F_impro03_F020 [156.2300-164.7969]: But It's sort of hard 'cause the weather is so unpredictable and then if it's like cold that day.  Or if it's too hot
Ses02F_impro03_M017 [164.5900-166.0400]: Spring's nice though.

Ses02F_impro03_F028 [231.8858-240.3492]: It's so girly.  I don't even know how to like--It's so weird
Ses02F_impro03_F029 [240.4223-244.0151]: She'll be like--flowers and the--

Ses02F_impro03_F030 [246.6500-250.5635]: Oh
Ses02F_impro04_M000 [005.1392-009.5052]: So
Ses02F_impro04_F000 [009.6322-019.0420]: I'm--every lead that I get ends up just being a dead end.  You know what I mean.  People are sick of me calling--
Ses02F_impro04_M001 [019.1897-025.4800]: No.  You can't think that way.  I mean it's good--it's good that you're--that you're calling
Ses02F_impro04_F001 [024.6700-028.9797]: Yeah
Ses02F_impro04_F002 [029.0536-034.9600]: Oh
Ses02F_impro04_M002 [034.8500-039.7200]: Yeah--I know what you mean.  I've gone through like similar stuff
F: It's just--
Ses02F_impro04_F003 [039.1700-046.3474]: But
Ses02F_impro04_M003 [045.8486-049.2500]: No
Ses02F_impro04_F004 [048.7571-054.0980]: I just--I can't do it anymore.  Like
Ses02F_impro04_M004 [052.9062-065.8663]: I know.  I know. It's hard
Ses02F_impro04_F005 [063.8300-074.6400]: I just keep getting rejected.  I just keep getting rejected over and over and over again and it starts to make you feel like there must be something wrong with you that you can't get a job.
Ses02F_impro04_M005 [074.5400-082.1500]: No.  It's--I mean
Ses02F_impro04_F006 [080.3700-091.5702]: Yeah
Ses02F_impro04_M006 [089.4093-097.0700]: There...There are plenty of people out there with--with like
Ses02F_impro04_M007 [097.1700-104.0000]: ...dumber than you.  I mean they're a lot worse off than you.  You are much better off than like a lot of those people in there. I know
Ses02F_impro04_F007 [102.4700-111.8000]: I didn't have like one of those starts
Ses02F_impro04_M008 [111.5500-116.4043]: I know.  It makes it harder.  I mean it's definitely who you know in a lot of cases
Ses02F_impro04_F008 [117.2799-129.1165]: It's just so frustrating.  Like
Ses02F_impro04_M009 [129.3592-135.0900]: But you gotta.  Otherwise
Ses02F_impro04_F009 [132.9672-135.2700]: I feel so worthless.
Ses02F_impro04_M010 [135.8500-145.0570]: It's not worthless 'cause it's definitely gonna--it's definitely gonna pay off.  I know it.  I mean
Ses02F_impro04_M011 [145.0670-151.0500]: ... and there's no reason that--that something won't come up like really soon.  All right?  So you just gotta--
Ses02F_impro04_F010 [150.3800-156.5983]: And what would make you say that?  There doesn't seem to be any indicators that anything's going to get better.
Ses02F_impro04_M012 [156.7354-174.3532]: Because I know you.  You know
Ses02F_impro04_F011 [173.3600-192.9300]: It's just really hard.  I feel like their starting to get like a personal prejudice against me.  You know what I mean?  Like it's like suddenly it starts to feel like it's just you that they say no to and it's not that they're not taking applications and it's not that they're not hiring people
Ses02F_impro04_M013 [192.8400-205.9900]: Well maybe yeah
Ses02F_impro04_F012 [204.9700-207.2100]: Or they'll never talk to me again.
Ses02F_impro04_M014 [207.1941-212.1841]: Or
Ses02F_impro04_F013 [212.2790-229.8000]: I-I just I think maybe I should try something else.  I mean
Ses02F_impro04_M015 [229.5000-242.2700]: That obviously that's not true though.  I mean
Ses02F_impro04_F014 [242.0100-248.8300]: I guess the money shouldn't matter to me
Ses02F_impro04_M016 [244.7900-245.9000]: Right.
Ses02F_impro04_M017 [245.9700-248.0000]: Well
Ses02F_impro04_F015 [248.8600-256.9182]: you have to--I mean
Ses02F_impro04_M018 [257.1676-266.4900]: I mean
Ses02F_impro04_F016 [266.3000-274.1700]: I just wanna crawl in a hole
Ses02F_impro04_M019 [271.6900-277.0401]: Well
Ses02F_impro04_F017 [276.0900-286.5100]: I don't know how to get out of it.  I don't know how to dig myself out of it.  It's the same hole that I've been digging and digging and digging.  I can't--
Ses02F_impro04_M020 [287.1900-288.5500]: I don't know.
Ses02F_impro05_F000 [004.1392-007.7911]: Hi
Ses02F_impro05_M000 [008.3000-012.9300]: Um

Ses02F_impro05_F002 [026.7500-029.3700]: Some problems?  What is that supposed to mean?
Ses02F_impro05_M002 [029.4200-035.9500]: Uh
Ses02F_impro05_F003 [035.2000-039.8027]: How do you lose a suitcase?  A huge suitcase?
Ses02F_impro05_M003 [039.8200-047.1700]: You know
Ses02F_impro05_M004 [047.1800-054.4300]: Uh
Ses02F_impro05_F004 [052.6500-054.1100]: How much?
Ses02F_impro05_M005 [054.5200-058.9138]: Um
Ses02F_impro05_F005 [059.0600-074.7800]: Fifty dollars?  For my suitcase?  I mean
Ses02F_impro05_M006 [074.4300-084.4500]: Right.  Uh We realize
Ses02F_impro05_F006 [082.2900-090.6800]: That's all
Ses02F_impro05_M007 [090.7700-097.6300]: I think
Ses02F_impro05_F007 [095.4200-101.5979]: Yes
Ses02F_impro05_M008 [101.6919-109.6800]: Right.  No.  I mean they- they might--they might--if you-if you are argue the case more
Ses02F_impro05_F008 [109.5300-115.6900]: I need my stuff.  It's--I need my stuff.  I mean
Ses02F_impro05_F009 [115.7200-120.1500]: Haven't you ever lost baggage?  I mean isn't there anything else you do?
Ses02F_impro05_M009 [118.1619-122.1723]: Yes
Ses02F_impro05_F010 [121.6100-124.5700]: Because you don't seem to care very much
Ses02F_impro05_M010 [124.0600-131.2021]: By checking your bags
Ses02F_impro05_F011 [130.4200-132.3500]: I didn't sign anything.
Ses02F_impro05_M011 [132.5430-140.2000]: Right
Ses02F_impro05_F012 [138.6400-148.6000]: I didn't agree.  [GARBAGE] I paid the airline to take care of things for me.  When you pay for something
Ses02F_impro05_M012 [147.7400-164.3900]: You paid for the flight and then your bags were checked at--it's a service that the airline provides for us.  So so
Ses02F_impro05_F013 [163.6300-176.7571]: [BREATHING] Well
Ses02F_impro05_M013 [176.4800-180.5000]: Well
Ses02F_impro05_F014 [179.5400-182.6500]: But fifty dollars isn't going to get me anything.
Ses02F_impro05_M014 [182.6000-189.6500]: No
Ses02F_impro05_F015 [189.5600-192.5100]: Isn't there anything else you can do?
Ses02F_impro05_M015 [189.6600-191.5400]: probably even talk to--
Ses02F_impro05_F016 [194.0678-206.9469]: I mean

Ses02F_impro05_F018 [225.4900-227.9400]: There needs to be better security here.
Ses02F_impro05_M019 [227.8100-242.3100]: Okay.  Well that that could be something that you put on on the claim--on on the complaint form if you want.  And provide us with your information while you're here and then

Ses02F_script01_1_M000 [010.1700-011.8100]: He saw it.
Ses02F_script01_1_F001 [011.5500-015.0800]: How could he see it?  I was the first one up
Ses02F_script01_1_M001 [014.9600-016.8000]: He was out here when it broke.
Ses02F_script01_1_F002 [016.5500-018.0000]: When?
Ses02F_script01_1_M002 [017.7378-024.9400]: About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked.
Ses02F_script01_1_F003 [024.5900-027.7900]: What was he doing out here at four in the morning?
Ses02F_script01_1_M003 [027.7000-033.8200]: I don't know.  When it cracked
Ses02F_script01_1_F004 [033.2025-035.1973]: Did you talk to him?
Ses02F_script01_1_M004 [034.6933-039.4500]: No.  I thought it was best to leave him alone.
Ses02F_script01_1_F005 [039.1000-041.8600]: He cried hard?
Ses02F_script01_1_M005 [041.0700-044.3927]: I could hear him right through the floor of my room.
Ses02F_script01_1_F006 [044.8800-047.1900]: What was he doing out here at that hour?
Ses02F_script01_1_F007 [047.2500-051.2394]: He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.
Ses02F_script01_1_M006 [051.3300-053.0700]: I guess he is.
Ses02F_script01_1_F008 [052.7600-058.2500]: He's getting just like after he died.  What is the meaning of that?
Ses02F_script01_1_M007 [058.6000-064.5900]: I don't know the meaning of it.  But

Ses02F_script01_1_F010 [070.0000-071.8500]: What you mean dishonest?
Ses02F_script01_1_M009 [072.1900-078.9600]: You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?
Ses02F_script01_1_F011 [078.2300-080.2700]: What do you want to do argue with him?
Ses02F_script01_1_M010 [079.9900-086.2800]: No
Ses02F_script01_1_M011 [086.3500-097.8000]: Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now?
Ses02F_script01_1_F012 [096.4800-098.7100]: You can't say that to him.
Ses02F_script01_1_M012 [098.2200-100.1600]: We've got to say it to him.
Ses02F_script01_1_F013 [099.8800-102.4300]: Can you prove it?  How can you prove it?
Ses02F_script01_1_M013 [102.0900-107.1800]: For God sakes
Ses02F_script01_1_F014 [106.4100-116.2200]: To you it is and to me

Ses02F_script01_1_F018 [142.5200-144.9616]: Well
Ses02F_script01_1_M018 [144.9300-147.7400]: You know it's not only my business.
Ses02F_script01_1_F019 [147.2000-150.7800]: What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
Ses02F_script01_1_M019 [150.8400-152.1600]: So it's all right then?
Ses02F_script01_1_M020 [152.1700-153.8100]: I'll go ahead with it?
Ses02F_script01_1_F020 [153.4400-157.3000]: Well
Ses02F_script01_1_M021 [155.7900-158.5800]: Well
Ses02F_script01_1_F021 [157.8100-159.7500]: I'm just saying that--
Ses02F_script01_1_M022 [158.8300-170.4500]: Ah
Ses02F_script01_1_F022 [169.5200-173.0200]: I ignore what I gotta ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.
Ses02F_script01_1_M023 [172.7400-174.7600]: She's not Larry's girl.
Ses02F_script01_1_F023 [173.9000-179.6300]: From your father's point of view
Ses02F_script01_1_F024 [179.6600-187.6800]: And you can go on from there if you know where to go
Ses02F_script01_1_M024 [187.6800-200.6209]: I don't know why
Ses02F_script01_1_F025 [199.5300-202.2400]: You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.
Ses02F_script01_1_M025 [201.9800-203.3600]: To hell with that.
Ses02F_script01_1_F026 [203.2237-206.3000]: [BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet?
Ses02F_script01_1_M026 [206.1200-208.4700]: I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses02F_script01_1_F027 [208.3300-212.7334]: Well
Ses02F_script01_1_M027 [212.7000-225.6616]: Well
Ses02F_script01_1_F028 [225.0100-227.9200]: Trouble is
Ses02F_script01_1_F029 [227.9500-229.4970]: You never did.
Ses02F_script01_1_M028 [229.2900-231.4600]: So what
Ses02F_script01_1_F030 [231.1923-234.0509]: I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses02F_script01_1_M029 [234.3900-235.9700]: Because it is.
Ses02F_script01_1_F031 [236.3101-244.8300]: Well
Ses02F_script01_1_M030 [244.3500-249.4900]: I can't help it.  I know her best.  I mean
Ses02F_script01_1_M031 [249.5400-253.7100]: These years when I think of a wife
Ses02F_script01_1_F032 [252.9100-261.3100]: I don't want a diagram.  Umm-- He thinks he's coming back
Ses02F_script01_1_F033 [261.3300-264.8800]: I mean
Ses02F_script01_1_M032 [263.8700-265.8200]: All right.  All right
Ses02F_script01_1_F034 [265.5800-268.2700]: I just--give it some more thought.
Ses02F_script01_1_M033 [268.0638-277.8066]: I've given it three years of thought.  I thought that if I waited Dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.
Ses02F_script01_1_M034 [277.8400-281.7400]: But if I can't--if that can't happen here
Ses02F_script01_1_F035 [281.7400-283.6600]: What the hell is this?
Ses02F_script01_1_M035 [283.7607-289.8709]: I'll get out.  I'll get married and go live some place else.  Maybe New York.
Ses02F_script01_1_F036 [289.0800-290.7700]: Are you crazy?
Ses02F_script01_1_M036 [290.2700-293.5400]: I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.
Ses02F_script01_1_F037 [293.3600-295.8800]: What about the business?  What the hell is this?
Ses02F_script01_1_M037 [295.5400-298.9900]: The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses02F_script01_1_F038 [298.4100-300.5800]: Must you be inspired?
Ses02F_script01_1_M038 [299.3700-306.8400]: Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long
Ses02F_script01_1_M039 [306.8900-316.3900]: I want a family.  I want kids.  I want something that I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now
Ses02F_script01_1_F039 [316.2500-319.8300]: Tell me
Ses02F_script01_1_M040 [319.9700-322.4800]: Yes
Ses02F_script01_1_F040 [322.4900-325.8319]: Well
Ses02F_script01_1_M041 [325.5800-328.5200]: Then help me stay here.
Ses02F_script01_1_F041 [326.7000-336.4000]: All right
Ses02F_script01_1_M042 [335.1600-338.9700]: I know.  I know
Ses02F_script01_1_F042 [339.2600-343.7600]: All right.  Just-- just don't go thinkin' that way
Ses02F_script01_1_M043 [343.3500-345.6700]: I am thinkin' that way.
Ses02F_script01_1_F043 [346.5600-349.8700]: I don't understand you
Ses02F_script01_1_M044 [350.0500-353.4300]: No
Ses02F_script01_1_F044 [353.5200-356.2000]: I can see that.
Ses02F_script01_2_F000 [005.8400-008.1200]: Why did he invite her here?
Ses02F_script01_2_M000 [008.0800-009.7200]: Why does that bother you?
Ses02F_script01_2_F001 [009.3000-013.5100]: She's been in New York for three and half years.  Why all of a sudden?
Ses02F_script01_2_M001 [012.5300-015.6600]: Well
Ses02F_script01_2_F002 [014.9600-018.7600]: Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
Ses02F_script01_2_M002 [018.6200-024.2000]: What do you mean?  He lived next door to the girl all his life.  Why wouldn't he want to see her again?
Ses02F_script01_2_M003 [024.5100-028.2000]: Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.
Ses02F_script01_2_F003 [027.7700-028.9000]: She's not-
Ses02F_script01_2_M004 [030.2300-032.5100]: How do you know he's even thinking of it?
Ses02F_script01_2_F004 [028.9200-030.7500]: -he's not gonna marry her.
Ses02F_script01_2_F005 [032.3100-034.4600]: It's got that all about it.
Ses02F_script01_2_M005 [035.8900-037.6100]: Well
Ses02F_script01_2_F006 [037.6000-039.7200]: What's going on here
Ses02F_script01_2_M006 [039.0100-040.9000]: Now
Ses02F_script01_2_F007 [039.7500-042.8400]: She's not his girl
Ses02F_script01_2_M007 [042.9200-044.8600]: You can't read her mind.
Ses02F_script01_2_F008 [044.5200-053.5100]: Well then why is she still single?  I mean
Ses02F_script01_2_M008 [053.2100-055.5600]: How do you know why she's waited?
Ses02F_script01_2_F009 [054.7100-063.7600]: She knows what I know
Ses02F_script01_2_M009 [063.9200-066.8200]: Look
Ses02F_script01_2_F010 [066.2400-074.5700]: Nobody in this house dares take her faith away
Ses02F_script01_2_M010 [074.4300-076.6800]: Well
Ses02F_script01_2_F011 [075.5000-084.1200]: I want you to act like he's coming back.  Both of you.  Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.
Ses02F_script01_2_M011 [083.8000-085.0700]: But Kate--
Ses02F_script01_2_F012 [084.7600-090.0000]: Because if he's not coming back
Ses02F_script01_2_F013 [090.0300-097.2500]: But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it.
Ses02F_script01_2_M012 [095.7600-097.4300]: Calm yourself.
Ses02F_script01_2_F014 [097.2700-100.9500]: Believe with me
Ses02F_script01_2_M013 [100.2100-102.1200]: Calm yourself.
Ses02F_script01_2_F015 [100.9600-106.1200]: Last week
Ses02F_script01_2_M014 [104.9000-107.8200]: All right.  All right.  Calm yourself.
Ses02F_script01_2_F016 [106.2700-109.4800]: You
Ses02F_script01_2_M015 [108.6900-111.7500]: What?- Why- Why me above all?
Ses02F_script01_2_F017 [111.1900-114.2492]: Just--just don't stop believing.
Ses02F_script01_2_M016 [114.0000-116.5000]: What does that mean?  Me above all?
Ses02F_script01_2_M017 [116.6100-118.9300]: Look at you.  Look at you shaking.
Ses02F_script01_2_F018 [117.9700-119.8700]: I can't help it.
Ses02F_script01_2_M018 [119.4300-123.8900]: What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate?
Ses02F_script01_2_F000 [005.8400-008.1200]: Why did he invite her here?
Ses02F_script01_2_M000 [008.0800-009.7200]: Why does that bother you?
Ses02F_script01_2_F001 [009.3000-013.5100]: She's been in New York for three and half years.  Why all of a sudden?
Ses02F_script01_2_M001 [012.5300-015.6600]: Well

Ses02F_script01_2_F004 [028.9200-030.7500]: -he's not gonna marry her.
Ses02F_script01_2_F005 [032.3100-034.4600]: It's got that all about it.
Ses02F_script01_2_M005 [035.8900-037.6100]: Well
Ses02F_script01_2_F006 [037.6000-039.7200]: What's going on here
Ses02F_script01_2_M006 [039.0100-040.9000]: Now

Ses02F_script01_2_M013 [100.2100-102.1200]: Calm yourself.
Ses02F_script01_2_F015 [100.9600-106.1200]: Last week
Ses02F_script01_2_M014 [104.9000-107.8200]: All right.  All right.  Calm yourself.
Ses02F_script01_2_F016 [106.2700-109.4800]: You
Ses02F_script01_2_M015 [108.6900-111.7500]: What?- Why- Why me above all?
Ses02F_script01_2_F017 [111.1900-114.2492]: Just--just don't stop believing.

Ses02F_script01_2_M018 [119.4300-123.8900]: What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate?
Ses02F_script01_3_F000 [006.6300-009.5400]: You're the only one I know who loves his parents.
Ses02F_script01_3_M000 [009.4400-012.1700]: I know
Ses02F_script01_3_F001 [012.1200-014.1000]: It's all right.  It's a good thing.
Ses02F_script01_3_F002 [014.9100-018.4600]: You know
Ses02F_script01_3_M001 [019.3800-021.0300]: You're not sorry you came?
Ses02F_script01_3_F003 [021.0900-026.8100]: No
Ses02F_script01_3_M002 [027.3900-028.5200]: Why?
Ses02F_script01_3_F004 [028.6400-032.7638]: Well
Ses02F_script01_3_M003 [032.5500-033.4700]: Oh.
Ses02F_script01_3_F005 [033.4200-040.8600]: You saw that.  I mean and then
Ses02F_script01_3_M004 [040.9500-041.8900]: What?
Ses02F_script01_3_F006 [041.9500-046.2900]: Well
Ses02F_script01_3_M005 [047.9700-057.1100]: The trouble is
Ses02F_script01_3_F007 [056.4918-058.7900]: I knew they would
M: How'd you know?
Ses02F_script01_3_F008 [060.8300-061.5000]: Well
Ses02F_script01_3_F009 [061.5400-064.1200]: from her point of view
Ses02F_script01_3_M006 [064.1368-071.7000]: Oh.  Would you want to?  I guess you know
Ses02F_script01_3_F010 [073.5900-078.0400]: I--I guess this is why I came.
Ses02F_script01_3_M007 [080.3500-087.6700]: Anne
Ses02F_script01_3_M008 [087.9400-090.8500]: I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.
Ses02F_script01_3_M009 [091.3200-099.9000]: I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.
Ses02F_script01_3_M010 [100.4000-109.9300]: You feel it's wrong here
Ses02F_script01_3_F011 [109.1400-112.3200]: Oh
Ses02F_script01_3_M011 [111.9600-114.4900]: And he's gone forever.  You're sure?
Ses02F_script01_3_F012 [115.7900-118.5420]: I almost got married two years ago.
Ses02F_script01_3_M012 [119.1197-120.3100]: Why didn't you?
Ses02F_script01_3_F013 [121.0300-123.4500]: You started to write me and--
Ses02F_script01_3_M013 [123.2600-124.9846]: You felt something that far back?
Ses02F_script01_3_F014 [124.8200-126.7000]: Every day since.
Ses02F_script01_3_M014 [127.0000-129.0500]: Anne
Ses02F_script01_3_F015 [129.0200-138.1000]: Well
Ses02F_script01_3_M015 [138.3100-140.6900]: Give me a kiss
Ses02F_script01_3_M016 [140.9400-146.8800]: oh God
Ses02F_script01_3_F016 [146.2400-154.8400]: I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.
Ses02F_script01_3_M017 [154.1100-157.8300]: Oh
Ses02F_script01_3_F017 [157.5900-159.2100]: Not like that you're not.
Ses02F_script01_3_M018 [159.1100-160.4000]: I kissed you.
Ses02F_script01_3_F018 [160.1500-166.7400]: Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you
Ses02F_script01_3_M019 [167.6900-170.4900]: Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.
Ses02F_script01_3_F019 [169.8100-173.3200]: No.  What is it
Ses02F_script01_3_M020 [173.5779-176.7000]: No.  Nothing like that.
Ses02F_script01_3_F020 [176.8257-185.9200]: Then
Ses02F_script01_3_M021 [186.5800-191.1500]: Yeah
Ses02F_script01_3_F021 [191.1300-193.3241]: You've gotta tell me.
Ses02F_script01_3_M022 [193.8700-196.2000]: I don't know how to start.
Ses02F_script01_3_F022 [196.6900-198.6400]: It wouldn't work this way.
Ses02F_script01_3_M023 [200.0900-207.2400]: It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas
Ses02F_script01_3_F023 [206.9900-208.4100]: Yeah
Ses02F_script01_3_M024 [209.2300-211.3800]: Well
Ses02F_script01_3_F024 [211.6000-213.3000]: How many?
Ses02F_script01_3_M025 [214.0700-215.6400]: Just about all.
Ses02F_script01_3_F025 [215.8937-217.6679]: Oh
Ses02F_script01_3_M026 [218.0900-223.2800]: It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.
Ses02F_script01_3_M027 [224.1600-238.3000]: For instance
Ses02F_script01_3_M028 [238.3700-247.3600]: They didn't die
Ses02F_script01_3_M029 [247.9400-261.6500]: I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed
Ses02F_script01_3_M030 [261.6900-273.3400]: You know what I mean?  To show that
Ses02F_script01_3_M031 [274.7500-290.0600]: Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.
Ses02F_script01_3_M032 [290.3500-307.6700]: And I felt what you said
Ses02F_script01_3_M033 [308.7100-320.4500]: I mean
Ses02F_script01_3_M034 [320.8300-330.7300]: Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.
Ses02F_script01_3_F026 [331.4300-333.6900]: You still feel that way?
Ses02F_script01_3_M035 [334.6100-336.6000]: I want you now Annie.
Ses02F_script01_3_F027 [336.9100-344.5400]: 'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything that you have.  Do you understand that?  Everything
Ses02F_script01_3_F028 [344.6000-353.2200]: I mean
Ses02F_script01_3_M036 [353.6400-357.8700]: I know Annie.  Annie
Ses02F_script01_3_F029 [357.6900-360.0600]: What'll I do with a fortune?
Ses02F_script02_1_M000 [005.2900-008.8900]: What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.
Ses02F_script02_1_M001 [008.9000-013.0300]: This is great
Ses02F_script02_1_M002 [013.0700-019.1800]: I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people
Ses02F_script02_1_M003 [019.2200-020.3100]: How you doing?
Ses02F_script02_1_F000 [020.1700-021.5100]: Fine.
Ses02F_script02_1_M004 [021.4000-026.6500]: Is that--no--is that just foam?  I can't even tell.
Ses02F_script02_1_M005 [026.6900-031.4300]: Well
Ses02F_script02_1_M006 [031.4700-039.6900]: How you doing?  Aw
Ses02F_script02_1_F001 [039.3900-040.5700]: What flashlight?
Ses02F_script02_1_M007 [041.2400-044.0500]: You know
Ses02F_script02_1_F002 [043.9900-045.7400]: That's not your flashlight.
Ses02F_script02_1_M008 [046.0000-047.2000]: Who's is it?
Ses02F_script02_1_F003 [046.9400-049.2100]: It's ours.  It's mine too.
Ses02F_script02_1_M009 [049.0100-050.5000]: Oh
Ses02F_script02_1_F004 [049.8400-055.5900]: You kept saying my flashlight
Ses02F_script02_1_M010 [055.3700-062.4000]: Right
Ses02F_script02_1_M011 [062.5000-067.4800]: How could we forget to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.
Ses02F_script02_1_M012 [068.1500-072.9000]: I wonder
Ses02F_script02_1_F005 [072.6900-073.9700]: Yeah.
Ses02F_script02_1_M013 [074.1600-079.7100]: You cold?  Do you want my jacket?  Oh
Ses02F_script02_1_M014 [080.2700-085.8500]: This is great
Ses02F_script02_1_M015 [085.9000-091.2500]: I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.
Ses02F_script02_1_M016 [093.4500-098.2100]: You think they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?
Ses02F_script02_1_F006 [098.2900-099.7700]: I'm cold.
Ses02F_script02_1_M017 [100.6000-102.0300]: Do you want my jacket?
Ses02F_script02_1_F007 [102.2100-104.8400]: It's after eleven
Ses02F_script02_1_M018 [105.1600-111.8200]: Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home.
Ses02F_script02_1_F008 [111.1200-113.5500]: There is no point in coming down here.
Ses02F_script02_1_M019 [113.3000-114.1900]: Right.
Ses02F_script02_1_F009 [113.9100-115.4000]: That's my point.
Ses02F_script02_1_M020 [115.1000-116.6000]: That's my point too.
Ses02F_script02_1_F010 [116.3800-117.6900]: So
Ses02F_script02_1_M021 [117.8300-124.5900]: No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?
Ses02F_script02_1_F011 [124.4400-126.1200]: Not particularly.
Ses02F_script02_1_M022 [126.4200-127.8200]: Why not?
Ses02F_script02_1_F012 [127.7300-130.4000]: I just don't.  It's stupid.
Ses02F_script02_1_M023 [130.9200-136.8600]: Honey
Ses02F_script02_1_M024 [136.8900-143.8500]: Think about the people in Kansas
Ses02F_script02_1_F013 [143.1900-150.1900]: Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach
Ses02F_script02_1_M025 [149.6700-159.0000]: Yeah
Ses02F_script02_1_M026 [159.0500-162.0100]: this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.
Ses02F_script02_1_F014 [161.3900-168.6000]: What are you so excited about?  I mean
Ses02F_script02_1_M027 [168.7200-170.3500]: Yeah they do.
Ses02F_script02_1_F015 [169.8600-171.2700]: Ah
Ses02F_script02_1_M028 [171.2300-179.6300]: Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.
Ses02F_script02_1_M029 [179.6700-186.6100]: There's--there's a bit of the magic--some unexplainable here.  I don't see how you can not be interested.
Ses02F_script02_1_F016 [185.8000-187.5400]: I'm just not.
Ses02F_script02_1_M030 [187.5800-188.7000]: For real?
Ses02F_script02_1_F017 [188.4300-189.7000]: Yeah.
Ses02F_script02_1_M031 [190.2800-194.7800]: I don't get it.  The first time we came here
Ses02F_script02_1_M032 [194.8400-202.5300]: And last year
Ses02F_script02_1_F018 [201.7700-211.4700]: Last year
Ses02F_script02_1_M033 [211.4300-213.0800]: We weren't in a good spot.
Ses02F_script02_1_F019 [212.7100-214.9300]: We didn't see them the first time either.
Ses02F_script02_1_M034 [214.5300-220.1000]: We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  Believe me
Ses02F_script02_1_M035 [220.6300-225.0800]: There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it?
Ses02F_script02_1_M036 [225.1400-233.2600]: Oh man
Ses02F_script02_1_M037 [233.3800-239.7300]: Somewhere out there
Ses02F_script02_1_M038 [240.0400-247.1500]: They don't know why
Ses02F_script02_1_M039 [247.1700-261.5400]: all as one
Ses02F_script02_1_M040 [261.7400-271.7000]: It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name.
Ses02F_script02_1_M041 [271.7100-280.1800]: They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand
Ses02F_script02_1_M042 [280.2100-284.6400]: Ah
Ses02F_script02_1_F020 [284.0400-285.6000]: That's the wind.
Ses02F_script02_1_M043 [285.9500-287.8700]: Well
Ses02F_script02_1_F021 [287.6800-289.1700]: About what?
Ses02F_script02_1_M044 [288.8000-290.2900]: What I was saying.
Ses02F_script02_1_F022 [290.4400-291.8400]: It's ridiculous.
Ses02F_script02_2_M000 [004.2700-006.3631]: Well
Ses02F_script02_2_F000 [006.3300-007.7200]: About what?
Ses02F_script02_2_M001 [007.7600-009.0700]: What I was saying.
Ses02F_script02_2_F001 [009.5015-011.2600]: It's ridiculous.
Ses02F_script02_2_M002 [011.4400-015.5300]: It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
Ses02F_script02_2_F002 [014.8100-021.4500]: It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is gonna take place on the beach.
Ses02F_script02_2_M003 [021.2400-023.6600]: Well
Ses02F_script02_2_F003 [022.9600-034.9800]: Sure
Ses02F_script02_2_M004 [034.6900-036.9000]: Are we talking about the same thing?
Ses02F_script02_2_F004 [036.0100-038.9700]: Well
Ses02F_script02_2_M005 [038.7300-045.5600]: Carla
Ses02F_script02_2_F005 [045.2100-052.6500]: God damn it
Ses02F_script02_2_M006 [051.7900-053.5100]: Well
Ses02F_script02_2_F006 [053.2000-057.7000]: We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.
Ses02F_script02_2_M007 [057.5500-067.7200]: There's nothing to it.  We come here
Ses02F_script02_2_F007 [067.3100-070.9800]: For heaven sake
Ses02F_script02_2_M008 [070.6700-072.0900]: Why not?
Ses02F_script02_2_F008 [071.7500-075.2300]: We never do
Ses02F_script02_2_M009 [075.0400-077.4500]: We've missed them twice.  That's not ever.
Ses02F_script02_2_F009 [076.8900-079.7300]: Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever.
Ses02F_script02_2_M010 [079.4000-081.1300]: Well
Ses02F_script02_2_F010 [080.7700-086.1500]: No
Ses02F_script02_2_F011 [086.1600-099.7100]: I mean
Ses02F_script02_2_M011 [099.6700-101.5000]: I thought you wanted to see it.
Ses02F_script02_2_F012 [101.2800-103.8100]: You don't understand anything I'm saying.
Ses02F_script02_2_M012 [103.5800-105.1700]: No
Ses02F_script02_2_F013 [104.9300-111.9000]: I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is.
Ses02F_script02_2_M013 [111.4600-114.7500]: It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about.
Ses02F_script02_2_F014 [113.2500-116.2300]: For heaven sake
Ses02F_script02_2_M014 [115.9200-124.0800]: All right.  Look
Ses02F_script02_2_M015 [124.1000-134.0900]: I mean
Ses02F_script02_2_M016 [134.1000-138.8100]: You said
Ses02F_script02_2_M017 [138.8600-144.9200]: Okay
Ses02F_script02_2_F015 [143.6900-149.7200]: Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago
Ses02F_script02_2_F016 [149.7400-159.7600]: I thought I was pregnant
Ses02F_script02_2_F017 [159.7833-169.3200]: And while we were dancing
Ses02F_script02_2_F018 [169.3400-178.1700]: And I remember thinking
Ses02F_script02_2_M018 [177.5600-179.3800]: Wait a minute.  I've got it.
Ses02F_script02_2_F019 [178.7800-183.3300]: Just dancing barefoot in the sand
Ses02F_script02_2_M019 [183.1800-192.2200]: It was in the car
Ses02F_script02_2_M020 [192.2500-197.0700]: Yeah
Ses02F_script02_2_F020 [196.7300-202.0100]: I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.
Ses02F_script02_2_M021 [201.3200-206.7400]: Okay
Ses02F_script02_2_F021 [206.4100-207.5500]: No.
Ses02F_script02_2_M022 [207.5100-209.4900]: You want me to go get some champagne?
Ses02F_script02_2_F022 [208.7400-209.7200]: No.
Ses02F_script02_2_M023 [209.5700-211.3200]: Take off our shoes?
Ses02F_script02_2_F023 [210.6800-211.8300]: No. No.
Ses02F_script02_2_M024 [211.3900-213.9400]: Well
Ses02F_script02_2_F024 [213.2000-214.0700]: No.
Ses02F_script02_2_M025 [213.9900-215.8600]: You wanna get married again?
Ses02F_script02_2_F025 [215.2100-216.2000]: No.
Ses02F_script02_2_M026 [215.9000-218.3600]: What?  What?  You want a divorce?
Ses02F_script02_2_F026 [217.4100-218.6800]: No.
Ses02F_script02_2_M027 [218.4100-219.7400]: A vacation?
Ses02F_script02_2_F027 [218.9300-220.1400]: No.
Ses02F_script02_2_M028 [219.7500-226.5400]: A new carpet?  A poodle?  Ice cream?  Back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What?  Carla
F: No.
Ses02F_script02_2_F028 [225.5700-229.1700]: I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.
Ses02F_script02_2_M029 [228.2000-238.9600]: Well
Ses02F_script02_2_M030 [239.3100-250.8600]: No.  You think I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like a used Kleenex?  Or that I'd look at you and think
Ses02F_script02_2_M031 [250.8900-266.4300]: No
Ses02F_script02_2_M032 [266.4400-269.3900]: 'cause you know what you get
Ses02F_script02_2_F029 [269.0000-274.0600]: This.  What?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
Ses02F_script02_2_M033 [273.8200-275.0800]: Yes
Ses02F_script02_2_F030 [274.8500-280.4500]: Uh
Ses02F_script02_2_M034 [280.1300-281.2200]: Right.
Ses02F_script02_2_F031 [281.5765-286.6000]: Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.
Ses02F_script02_2_M035 [286.3300-288.2900]: I know
Ses02F_script02_2_F032 [288.2400-302.7400]: I mean
Ses02F_script02_2_M036 [302.9300-305.0600]: I'm doing the best I can.
Ses02F_script02_2_F033 [305.3800-308.7200]: I know that
Ses02F_script02_2_F034 [308.7500-324.1000]: I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all
Ses02F_script02_2_M037 [325.0600-327.9300]: Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
Ses02F_script02_2_F035 [327.1500-328.7700]: I didn't say that.
Ses02F_script02_2_M038 [328.3800-333.7100]: No
Ses02F_script02_2_F036 [332.8400-337.1400]: Oh
Ses02F_script02_2_M039 [337.8400-339.0300]: Yeah?
Ses02F_script02_2_F037 [338.7300-341.9900]: Oh
Ses02F_script02_2_F038 [342.0800-350.2000]: You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.
Ses02F_script02_2_M040 [350.5661-355.2400]: Well
Ses02F_script02_2_F039 [357.0600-364.8300]: Okay.  Fine so.  We're in the wrong spot
Ses02F_script02_2_M041 [364.8100-370.5600]: I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean
Ses02F_script02_2_F040 [370.6400-377.7300]: Yeah
Ses02F_script02_2_M042 [378.2800-380.2100]: Well
Ses02F_script02_2_F041 [379.8700-382.7600]: Augie
Ses02F_script02_2_M043 [382.4300-384.0800]: It's not champagne.
Ses02F_script02_2_F042 [383.7000-387.6000]: Well
Ses02F_script02_2_M044 [388.8800-392.0800]: You still cold?  Do you wanna go home?
Ses02F_script02_2_F043 [393.4100-402.2600]: No.  I think you might be right.  Maybe this is the spot after all.
Ses02F_script02_2_F044 [405.9300-408.2600]: Augie
Ses02F_script02_2_M045 [407.0800-411.6900]: Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.
Ses02F_script02_2_F045 [412.1500-413.9200]: Or not.
Ses02F_script02_2_M046 [414.0500-415.6400]: Or not.
Ses02F_script03_1_M000 [005.4400-006.5300]: Good God.
Ses02F_script03_1_F000 [006.3800-007.6300]: Do you think it's them?
Ses02F_script03_1_M001 [007.7100-008.8000]: I wonder.
Ses02F_script03_1_F001 [008.7500-012.4900]: Well
Ses02F_script03_1_M002 [012.2200-014.0600]: Must be them
Ses02F_script03_1_F002 [013.7700-016.2400]: What're we gonna do?
Ses02F_script03_1_M003 [016.9000-019.5900]: We're all right
Ses02F_script03_1_F003 [019.2500-021.4200]: Now and always
Ses02F_script03_1_M004 [020.6500-022.1800]: I don't care then.
Ses02F_script03_1_F004 [021.9700-024.2300]: It was bound to come sooner or later.
Ses02F_script03_1_M005 [023.9100-028.8000]: Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.
Ses02F_script03_1_F005 [028.4000-032.4500]: Ah
Ses02F_script03_1_M006 [032.0000-034.7300]: What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us?
Ses02F_script03_1_F006 [034.4900-036.7600]: Behave exquisitely.
Ses02F_script03_1_M007 [036.5300-038.4000]: With the most perfect poise?
Ses02F_script03_1_F007 [037.7000-041.5500]: Oh
Ses02F_script03_1_M008 [041.2000-045.8900]: Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?
Ses02F_script03_1_F008 [045.2300-048.8800]: What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.
Ses02F_script03_1_M009 [048.1500-050.1700]: Oh
Ses02F_script03_1_F009 [049.6500-053.3200]: It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.
Ses02F_script03_1_M010 [053.1800-056.9300]: Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing
Ses02F_script03_1_F010 [056.3800-058.7300]: Yes
Ses02F_script03_1_M011 [058.2600-067.1000]: Oh
Ses02F_script03_1_F011 [065.8400-068.4000]: Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.
Ses02F_script03_1_M012 [068.0000-070.9400]: You mustn't be serious
Ses02F_script03_1_F012 [070.5100-071.7600]: Who's they?
Ses02F_script03_1_M013 [071.4200-078.6400]: All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.
Ses02F_script03_1_M014 [078.6500-082.1400]: Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.
Ses02F_script03_1_F013 [081.7800-084.7900]: If I laugh at everything
Ses02F_script03_1_M015 [084.5000-087.2800]: Certainly
Ses02F_script03_1_F014 [086.9300-092.2600]: Well how long will it last us
Ses02F_script03_1_M016 [092.0100-093.3700]: Who knows.
Ses02F_script03_1_F015 [093.3100-096.5400]: Well
Ses02F_script03_1_M017 [096.2300-099.7400]: No
Ses02F_script03_1_F016 [099.0400-101.3500]: Oh
Ses02F_script03_1_M018 [101.1000-103.3300]: Depends on how well we've played.
Ses02F_script03_1_F017 [103.0200-109.2400]: Well
Ses02F_script03_1_M019 [108.6800-111.9600]: Yes.  Yes. With all his might.
Ses02F_script03_1_F018 [111.3700-113.4300]: That's serious enough
Ses02F_script03_1_M020 [112.7900-118.2800]: No. No
Ses02F_script03_1_F019 [117.5200-119.9700]: Darling
Ses02F_script03_1_M021 [119.4800-122.2200]: So is everyone else in the long run.
Ses02F_script03_1_M022 [122.2600-136.2100]: Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can.  Like quite idiotic
Ses02F_script03_1_M023 [136.2304-140.6300]: Come and kiss me
Ses02F_script03_1_F020 [140.2000-142.4300]: Elliott
Ses02F_script03_1_M024 [142.8200-153.4900]: I don't care what you do.  See
Ses02F_script03_1_F021 [152.9500-160.5700]: Oh
Ses02F_script03_1_M025 [160.0100-162.6809]: You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
Ses02F_script03_1_F022 [162.7044-164.7400]: Which particular one?
Ses02F_script03_1_M026 [164.3100-169.1600]: The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.
Ses02F_script03_1_F023 [168.4300-173.2000]: Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully.
Ses02F_script03_1_M027 [172.5500-175.0600]: Ah
Ses02F_script03_1_F024 [174.1900-179.8500]: Yes
Ses02F_script03_1_M028 [179.5600-181.6500]: How long did that row last?
Ses02F_script03_1_F025 [181.0200-183.9300]: It went in intermittently for days.
Ses02F_script03_1_M029 [183.4900-189.0200]: The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.
Ses02F_script03_1_F026 [187.4000-191.6500]: It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
Ses02F_script03_1_M030 [190.9300-192.8400]: That was a rouser
Ses02F_script03_1_F027 [192.5900-195.5500]: That was the first time you ever hit me.
Ses02F_script03_1_M031 [195.4500-197.6700]: I didn't hit you very hard.
Ses02F_script03_1_F028 [197.0900-204.3900]: The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor
Ses02F_script03_1_M032 [202.7400-205.3600]: Oh
Ses02F_script03_1_F029 [204.8400-208.5300]: It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous.
Ses02F_script03_1_M033 [208.2100-210.4500]: We were very much younger then.
Ses02F_script03_1_F030 [210.1100-212.7800]: And very much sillier.
Ses02F_script03_1_M034 [212.4200-217.2000]: As a matter of fact
Ses02F_script03_2_M000 [004.6200-008.2800]: As a matter of fact
Ses02F_script03_2_F000 [007.5900-010.0300]: Honey
Ses02F_script03_2_M001 [009.5800-012.6200]: I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
Ses02F_script03_2_F001 [012.2400-015.0900]: Presents?  Just a trivial little broach.
Ses02F_script03_2_M002 [014.4100-020.1700]: Ah
Ses02F_script03_2_F002 [019.0700-023.3500]: No
Ses02F_script03_2_M003 [023.0300-026.3000]: You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses02F_script03_2_F003 [025.1500-029.6300]: No
Ses02F_script03_2_M004 [028.9700-031.7100]: You must admit
Ses02F_script03_2_F004 [031.1600-034.1000]: Just a little perhaps
Ses02F_script03_2_M005 [033.7500-035.7900]: You let him kiss you.  You said you did.
Ses02F_script03_2_F005 [035.4700-036.9100]: Well
Ses02F_script03_2_M006 [036.6600-037.8300]: What of it?
Ses02F_script03_2_F006 [037.4400-042.1100]: It didn't hurt him at all and I enjoyed it.
Ses02F_script03_2_M007 [041.8500-043.9400]: Well
Ses02F_script03_2_F007 [043.8300-048.3300]: Well
Ses02F_script03_2_M008 [048.0300-050.8200]: Well
Ses02F_script03_2_F008 [050.8000-053.0600]: I'm bored with this conversation.
Ses02F_script03_2_M009 [052.7500-056.9000]: Me
Ses02F_script03_2_F009 [056.5600-058.1200]: No
Ses02F_script03_2_M010 [057.6500-059.6300]: I think I'll have some.
Ses02F_script03_2_F010 [059.4100-063.1300]: Don't see why you want any.  You've already had two glasses.
Ses02F_script03_2_M011 [063.2000-066.6400]: No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.
Ses02F_script03_2_F011 [066.6500-070.7700]: Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.
Ses02F_script03_2_M012 [070.5000-076.5400]: You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.
Ses02F_script03_2_F012 [075.5400-078.3300]: Well
Ses02F_script03_2_M013 [077.5600-082.4000]: You needn't be so grand
Ses02F_script03_2_F013 [081.2800-083.3600]: Don't be so stupid.
Ses02F_script03_2_M014 [082.6400-084.2300]: Really
Ses02F_script03_2_F014 [083.4100-084.5500]: What?
Ses02F_script03_2_M015 [084.3600-085.3200]: Nothing.
Ses02F_script03_2_M016 [088.1200-090.6800]: Going out somewhere dear?
Ses02F_script03_2_F015 [090.6800-094.5200]: No
Ses02F_script03_2_M017 [094.3700-096.8300]: That reply has broken my heart.
Ses02F_script03_2_F016 [096.5600-101.8200]: A woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute
Ses02F_script03_2_M018 [101.6700-104.2300]: As a matter of fact
Ses02F_script03_2_F017 [103.8300-105.5700]: No
Ses02F_script03_2_M019 [104.8700-106.2500]: Yes
Ses02F_script03_2_F018 [105.6100-107.7100]: Oh
Ses02F_script03_2_M020 [107.2000-111.5600]: Ah
Ses02F_script03_2_F019 [110.5000-113.5500]: Doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.
Ses02F_script03_2_M021 [113.0700-115.8000]: Snap
Ses02F_script03_2_F020 [115.5200-117.5600]: Adders don't snap
Ses02F_script03_2_M022 [117.1700-121.1900]: Nonsense.  They have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.
Ses02F_script03_2_F021 [120.5000-121.6800]: They sting.
Ses02F_script03_2_M023 [121.2100-122.6900]: They snap.
Ses02F_script03_2_F022 [122.0300-127.8900]: I don't care
Ses02F_script03_2_M024 [128.8500-132.6300]: Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
Ses02F_script03_2_F023 [132.3600-134.5600]: Yes
Ses02F_script03_2_M025 [134.3600-137.9700]: Hmm
Ses02F_script03_2_F024 [137.7400-139.5100]: Mind your own business.
Ses02F_script03_2_M026 [139.0600-145.5800]: Oh
Ses02F_script03_2_F025 [145.0800-146.9400]: You're quite insufferable
Ses02F_script03_2_F026 [146.9600-148.6000]: I expect it's because you're drunk.
Ses02F_script03_2_M027 [148.2500-150.5600]: I'm not in the least drunk.
Ses02F_script03_2_F027 [149.7000-152.0600]: You've always had a weak head.
Ses02F_script03_2_M028 [151.6600-159.6700]: As I mentioned before
Ses02F_script03_2_F028 [158.7800-163.6000]: On the contrary
Ses02F_script03_2_M029 [163.2700-168.5800]: Oh
Ses02F_script03_2_F029 [167.4500-169.2900]: Shut up.
Ses02F_script03_2_M030 [168.6300-172.8500]: We could get a good debate going about this
Ses02F_script03_2_F030 [171.8500-175.6300]: Not very funny
Ses02F_script03_2_M031 [175.2600-177.5400]: All right.  I will.
Ses02F_script03_2_M032 [180.0500-181.9200]: You better turn that off
Ses02F_script03_2_F031 [181.6200-183.1100]: Why?
Ses02F_script03_2_M033 [183.1000-186.5000]: Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs.
Ses02F_script03_2_F032 [185.6900-189.7300]: There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.
Ses02F_script03_2_M034 [189.3400-191.9800]: There are people downstairs I suppose?
Ses02F_script03_2_F033 [191.0300-192.9700]: They're away in Tunis.
Ses02F_script03_2_M035 [193.3500-196.0100]: This is no time of the year for Tunis.
Ses02F_script03_2_F034 [195.9400-198.2100]: Turn it on again
Ses02F_script03_2_M036 [197.8700-199.9800]: I'll do no such thing.
Ses02F_script03_2_F035 [199.5800-204.2100]: Very well
Ses02F_script03_2_M037 [203.7700-206.4800]: Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
Ses02F_script03_2_F036 [205.6900-209.7500]: You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
Ses02F_script03_2_M038 [208.9600-210.2100]: Turn it off.
Ses02F_script03_2_F037 [209.8900-212.3000]: Stop it.  Go away.  I hate you.
Ses02F_script03_2_M039 [211.3600-213.5500]: Amanda
Ses02F_script03_2_F038 [212.3400-217.8700]: Listen?  Listen
Ses02F_script03_2_M040 [217.1900-219.3200]: Very amusing
Ses02F_script03_2_F039 [218.4900-224.8200]: I hate you.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I hate you
Ses02F_script03_2_M041 [224.2000-231.0300]: You're a vile
Ses02F_script03_2_F040 [230.0800-234.2200]: This is the end.  Finally and forever.  Do you hear me?  The end.
Ses02F_script03_2_M042 [233.6300-235.6200]: You're not going like this.
Ses02F_script03_2_F041 [234.4800-236.4400]: Oh Yes
Ses02F_script03_2_M043 [235.8700-237.3600]: You're not.
Ses02F_script03_2_F042 [236.4800-241.0600]: I am.  Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you.
Ses02F_script03_2_M044 [239.2200-241.1500]: Shut up. Shut up.
Ses02F_script03_2_M045 [241.7900-243.5800]: I wouldn't-- I wouldn't marry--
Ses02F_script03_2_M046 [243.5900-246.4400]: I wouldn't marry you if you came in crawling on your knees
Ses02F_script03_2_F043 [241.0800-251.9500]: Thank God I realized what you are-- I'd never marry you again ever in my life. You're a cruel fiend and I hate you. You're a beast. You're a beast--I hate you. Stop it.  Stop it.
Ses02F_script03_2_M047 [246.4700-250.6200]: You're a evil vampire and I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.
Ses02M_impro01_M000 [003.5000-006.4410]: All right. Finally. Here you go.
Ses02M_impro01_F000 [005.3200-007.3580]: Hi
Ses02M_impro01_M001 [007.3400-010.0000]: Yea. I just want to get this done
Ses02M_impro01_F001 [010.3710-011.6114]: Sure
Ses02M_impro01_M002 [010.0100-012.2924]: get my new license.
Ses02M_impro01_F002 [011.6114-014.6855]: do you have two forms of ID with you?
Ses02M_impro01_M003 [014.3252-017.6205]: Um
Ses02M_impro01_F003 [017.8190-024.7376]: I actually need two forms of ID. I need either a passport or a birth certificate
Ses02M_impro01_M004 [024.5138-028.1500]: Uh
Ses02M_impro01_F004 [027.9800-029.6220]: Well
Ses02M_impro01_M005 [028.2300-031.2973]: well is the dri-driver's license going to work?
Ses02M_impro01_F005 [030.0939-036.9427]: I- I can take your driver's license but I need another form of ID in order to process this paper work.
Ses02M_impro01_M006 [036.8679-039.1999]: Okay
Ses02M_impro01_F006 [038.8667-044.0823]: Um
Ses02M_impro01_M007 [044.2341-052.4300]: What? I- You telling me I waited in that huge line to go and sit down and get my number called
Ses02M_impro01_F007 [053.1100-054.9300]: Well
Ses02M_impro01_M008 [052.4400-054.5300]: three hours and
Ses02M_impro01_F008 [054.9400-058.3100]: you need to bring two forms of ID there is nothing we can do about it.
Ses02M_impro01_M009 [057.3791-064.1421]: Shouldn't they have like told us about that? I mean why - why would they make me go and wait three hours if I have got to go and do it again?
Ses02M_impro01_F009 [060.0864-061.5056]: Well
Ses02M_impro01_F010 [063.2229-068.4976]: It's standard that you bring a couple of forms of ID
Ses02M_impro01_M010 [066.9831-073.6261]: It's standard? I mean I don't work at the D.M.V. how am I supposed to know that
Ses02M_impro01_F011 [071.2864-074.6495]: Well
Ses02M_impro01_M011 [074.2423-076.2871]: I filled out the application right
Ses02M_impro01_F012 [076.0075-082.1167]: Yes
Ses02M_impro01_M012 [081.5927-088.7760]: Okay. What about - no -- how about you hold that and I'll - I'll go and I can come back-
Ses02M_impro01_F013 [087.4655-091.6580]: I'm sorry
Ses02M_impro01_M013 [091.1995-093.9287]: I've been waiting for three hours.
Ses02M_impro01_F014 [093.4266-097.4221]: It just happens to people all the time
Ses02M_impro01_M014 [097.1601-099.5400]: This is ridiculous. Come on
Ses02M_impro01_F015 [098.7147-100.1295]: I'm sorry
Ses02M_impro01_M015 [099.9890-104.6996]: I cannot go back in that line. I've got stuff I need to do
Ses02M_impro01_F016 [104.7414-106.0901]: there is nothing I can do.
Ses02M_impro01_M016 [105.4351-112.2472]: But my driver's license - I had to have my birth certificate to get my driver's license in the first place right
Ses02M_impro01_F017 [111.7499-115.9590]: I know sir
Ses02M_impro01_M017 [115.4350-118.7100]: That doesn't make any sense. Why?
Ses02M_impro01_F018 [118.3825-120.5877]: I'm sorry
Ses02M_impro01_M018 [119.1904-126.0898]: You- shouldn't you have like a sign or something maybe like up on the counter when you get the applica- maybe on the application
Ses02M_impro01_F019 [122.8148-125.8060]: Well
Ses02M_impro01_F020 [126.2997-130.8496]: If you had checked the website it would have said that you needed two forms of identification.
Ses02M_impro01_M019 [129.4304-137.7264]: What web- I didn't go to a website - why would I need to - it's the D.M.V.. You come to the D.M.V.
Ses02M_impro01_F021 [137.2469-138.7534]: Well
Ses02M_impro01_M020 [138.3822-141.7665]: I waited in line now I'm ready to get my stuff and then go home.
Ses02M_impro01_F022 [141.3516-146.0022]: Right. So maybe you should go home now and get your paperwork and come back.
Ses02M_impro01_F023 [148.0459-153.3206]: I'm sorry sir but there's a lot of people waiting. So if you won't move out of the way
Ses02M_impro01_M021 [149.4956-151.5261]: God
Ses02M_impro01_M022 [153.3165-155.0414]: This is ridiculous.
Ses02M_impro01_F024 [154.5392-157.0808]: I'm sorry
Ses02M_impro02_F000 [003.9987-006.0541]: I don't want you to go.
Ses02M_impro02_M000 [007.0366-015.1000]: I know
Ses02M_impro02_F001 [015.5524-023.3599]: I'm going to miss you too; I don't know what I'm going to do here without you. It's going to be so lonely
M: It'll be alright.
Ses02M_impro02_F002 [023.5790-026.4151]: I don't want to be a single mom.
Ses02M_impro02_M001 [026.7598-031.4253]: You won't be. I'll be back; I'll be back before you know it. All right
Ses02M_impro02_F003 [031.3058-032.6401]: but
Ses02M_impro02_M002 [032.6800-033.6558]: and
Ses02M_impro02_F004 [033.4566-037.3201]: It's dangerous; I mean how can you make sure that you'll
M: it'll- it'll
Ses02M_impro02_M003 [037.5389-044.4296]: It's- It's dangerous anywhere
Ses02M_impro02_M004 [044.4743-054.8649]: I'll come back we'll have
Ses02M_impro02_F005 [054.0200-055.5818]: I hope so.
Ses02M_impro02_M005 [055.4225-056.8962]: A little family.
Ses02M_impro02_F006 [056.6174-058.0712]: I hope so.
Ses02M_impro02_M006 [058.1707-059.5249]: You gotta
Ses02M_impro02_F007 [059.0868-061.0584]: It's going to be really rough.
Ses02M_impro02_M007 [061.7187-063.7973]: You gotta take care of our baby for me
F: Without you
Ses02M_impro02_F008 [064.7625-067.7895]: I'll send you lots of pictures.
Ses02M_impro02_M008 [067.8916-074.1377]: I hope so
Ses02M_impro02_M009 [075.0360-084.1992]: I've never been - I've never been away from you for two weeks let alone a year.
Ses02M_impro02_F009 [084.1439-088.9590]: Well
Ses02M_impro02_F010 [089.8468-096.5662]: I mean can't they put you in like
Ses02M_impro02_M010 [096.5942-099.7326]: No
Ses02M_impro02_M011 [101.0854-108.0313]: but
Ses02M_impro02_F011 [108.5118-112.6479]: It doesn't make any sense; I don't know why we have to be at war in the first place.
Ses02M_impro02_M012 [113.8282-119.8340]: I know
Ses02M_impro02_M013 [120.2518-128.8678]: there's people that thought it was the right thing to do so now we have to- we have to do what we have to do for our country
Ses02M_impro02_M014 [129.5686-137.7099]: and it'll work out you know
Ses02M_impro02_F012 [137.8409-142.0114]: Will you write me letters
Ses02M_impro02_M015 [141.7127-148.2248]: Yeah
Ses02M_impro02_M016 [148.5469-155.0556]: Yeah
Ses02M_impro02_F013 [155.7643-160.4854]: Our baby needs a dad; you can't leave. Okay
Ses02M_impro02_M017 [159.4932-164.3000]: Our baby has a dad
Ses02M_impro02_M018 [165.8300-178.4193]: I want you to
Ses02M_impro02_F014 [178.7739-181.4226]: I'll miss you too.
Ses02M_impro03_M000 [003.1431-005.5530]: Oh
Ses02M_impro03_F000 [005.2402-009.0515]: What? What? You look really happy what's going on?
Ses02M_impro03_M001 [009.1156-012.3065]: Well
Ses02M_impro03_F001 [012.1230-014.0146]: Finally did what?
Ses02M_impro03_M002 [014.1737-017.6149]: I-I asked her to marry me.
Ses02M_impro03_F002 [017.3302-021.2960]: You did? Oh
Ses02M_impro03_M003 [021.2152-023.3916]: Yes
Ses02M_impro03_F003 [023.2289-025.5477]: Oh
M: God. 
Ses02M_impro03_M004 [024.8000-027.6835]: I'm so nervous you know
Ses02M_impro03_F004 [026.9512-028.2937]: Did she say yes?
Ses02M_impro03_M005 [028.2293-031.5075]: Yes
Ses02M_impro03_F005 [031.1617-032.9110]: That's like the most definitive.
Ses02M_impro03_M006 [032.6098-036.6537]: I know Uhm- I can't believe it.  It's like-
Ses02M_impro03_F006 [036.4389-040.3353]: Oh
Ses02M_impro03_F007 [040.5591-044.4238]: I would have thought you would have told me that you were planning on doing this.
Ses02M_impro03_M007 [043.7500-049.8600]: Well
Ses02M_impro03_F008 [048.8635-053.0889]: Yea
Ses02M_impro03_M008 [053.0400-058.3300]: Yes
Ses02M_impro03_F009 [057.8600-058.8100]: Yeah.
Ses02M_impro03_M009 [058.3367-064.1134]: I - I think it was about time
Ses02M_impro03_F010 [063.3405-065.1508]: So what did you do?
Ses02M_impro03_M010 [065.1724-072.7300]: Oh
Ses02M_impro03_M011 [072.7400-076.1400]: so I-I talked to some of the crew before hand and-
Ses02M_impro03_F011 [074.9550-077.0704]: Oh
Ses02M_impro03_M012 [076.8059-077.7009]: I-I did.
Ses02M_impro03_F012 [077.0907-080.5700]: Oh
Ses02M_impro03_M013 [079.2909-085.5320]: So I got the band to do something
Ses02M_impro03_F013 [085.3339-094.6853]: That's so romantic. Oh
Ses02M_impro03_M014 [086.8300-088.3000]: I know
Ses02M_impro03_M015 [088.4600-090.1494]: I got to freak her out.
Ses02M_impro03_M016 [094.4412-095.8040]: No
Ses02M_impro03_F014 [095.4379-096.8617]: She must have flipped out.
Ses02M_impro03_M017 [096.6583-100.2790]: Yea
Ses02M_impro03_F015 [099.6891-103.4785]: Right exactly because you can't say no in front of thousands of people. [LAUGHTER]
Ses02M_impro03_M018 [103.3300-104.9776]: No
Ses02M_impro03_F016 [104.4488-106.5845]: Did you bring her up on stage too?
Ses02M_impro03_M019 [105.9947-107.4795]: Yes
Ses02M_impro03_F017 [107.2558-109.6966]: Oh
Ses02M_impro03_M020 [109.5372-114.5874]: I know it was
Ses02M_impro03_F018 [113.3783-115.3716]: Are your parents excited or...?
Ses02M_impro03_M021 [115.1625-119.6025]: Oh yes
Ses02M_impro03_F019 [119.1334-121.5600]: Yea
Ses02M_impro03_M022 [121.6073-129.4938]: Well
Ses02M_impro03_M023 [129.9508-139.6990]: I don't know either do a honeymoon like in the snow or fly down to like Australia
Ses02M_impro03_F020 [135.3700-137.9500]: Ooh
Ses02M_impro03_F021 [139.3125-143.6450]: Do you think you'll get a house or something
Ses02M_impro03_M024 [143.6282-150.2993]: Yea
Ses02M_impro03_F022 [149.5800-150.6600]: Yeah. [LAUGHTER]
Ses02M_impro03_M025 [150.3093-156.8328]: but like you know it's just - I guess we're just excited right now that we'll get to continue it together.
Ses02M_impro03_F023 [152.6886-157.9201]: Oh my Gosh. I cannot believe you're getting married
Ses02M_impro03_M026 [157.6190-158.9208]: I know.
Ses02M_impro03_F024 [158.8655-164.7588]: Golly
Ses02M_impro03_M027 [164.7903-172.9558]: Oh
F: That's so fun. Oh my gosh.
Ses02M_impro03_F025 [171.6540-174.8068]: Did you have a good ring? You better have had a good ring.
Ses02M_impro03_M028 [174.7051-176.4340]: Sure. Oh
F: Good.
Ses02M_impro03_F026 [176.1086-178.9562]: Good. The ring makes all the difference.
Ses02M_impro03_M029 [178.5291-183.8500]: You know I had my mom come along maybe help me out a little bit because she's got good taste. but
F: Good
Ses02M_impro03_F027 [183.5700-185.3300]: Oh
Ses02M_impro03_M030 [185.2618-189.2079]: Yes
Ses02M_impro03_F028 [186.1365-191.4453]: Yay
Ses02M_impro03_M031 [190.9368-191.8928]: Hah.
Ses02M_impro04_M000 [003.6516-006.4730]: Uhm
Ses02M_impro04_F000 [005.1157-006.9185]: So how you feeling?
Ses02M_impro04_M001 [006.4730-009.4965]: I don't know what I'm going to do about this; I mean
Ses02M_impro04_M002 [010.8729-013.3083]: I have got to get a job
Ses02M_impro04_F001 [013.1185-016.2387]: You've been doing a lot of work for it
Ses02M_impro04_M003 [016.0012-020.9300]: Well
Ses02M_impro04_F002 [024.9578-028.1900]: Right
Ses02M_impro04_M004 [020.9900-026.2590]: I go out all the places I can
Ses02M_impro04_F003 [028.2000-031.7400]: you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that
Ses02M_impro04_M005 [031.6000-037.9371]: But it's been so long
Ses02M_impro04_F004 [037.9351-040.8943]: Well
Ses02M_impro04_M006 [037.9705-041.5407]: I don't know
Ses02M_impro04_M007 [041.6743-054.6257]: Yea
F: Yeah
Ses02M_impro04_F005 [054.7510-061.4736]: I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and
Ses02M_impro04_M008 [060.9668-066.3650]: Well
Ses02M_impro04_M009 [066.4532-073.5619]: I don't even know if it's going to be worth it because I can't break myself in
Ses02M_impro04_F006 [073.8543-079.1665]: Well
Ses02M_impro04_M010 [078.9722-085.4061]: Yea
F: No it means you have persistence.
Ses02M_impro04_F007 [085.5106-089.9409]: You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's
Ses02M_impro04_M011 [088.3105-099.2349]: I mean
Ses02M_impro04_F008 [096.7713-103.3594]: Well
Ses02M_impro04_M012 [103.4023-110.5203]: I mean
Ses02M_impro04_M013 [110.7240-117.3947]: I just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out and
Ses02M_impro04_F009 [117.7600-119.5800]: I'm sorry.
Ses02M_impro04_M014 [117.9015-123.4099]: I don't know
Ses02M_impro04_M015 [123.5710-128.1600]: maybe - maybe take up painting
Ses02M_impro04_M016 [128.1700-133.7877]: Do something that I don't have to go out and do something
Ses02M_impro04_M017 [133.8097-141.1249]: Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment.
Ses02M_impro04_F010 [139.5605-145.0028]: That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not
Ses02M_impro04_F011 [145.0661-155.5569]: and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean
Ses02M_impro04_F012 [155.6450-159.2365]: So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.
Ses02M_impro04_M018 [157.4958-167.7000]: I know
Ses02M_impro04_F013 [167.7833-174.1000]: It might be the latter I don't know because you're not the worst
Ses02M_impro04_M019 [167.7100-170.9900]: this doesn't happen to a normal person.
Ses02M_impro04_F014 [174.1100-180.8000]: You know and the fact you still here and still cooking
Ses02M_impro04_F015 [180.8100-188.2546]: But like
Ses02M_impro04_M020 [188.6831-195.9884]: I mean
Ses02M_impro04_F016 [196.1824-201.1541]: Maybe you should take a little break from it
M: Maybe-
Ses02M_impro04_M021 [201.2104-203.4798]: What am I going to do on a break?
Ses02M_impro04_F017 [203.2900-215.0474]: Get out of town or something
Ses02M_impro04_M022 [214.4085-217.5372]: Right. Thanks for talking to me.
Ses02M_impro05_M000 [002.6966-003.9776]: Hi. Um-
Ses02M_impro05_F000 [003.6155-004.8484]: Hi
Ses02M_impro05_M001 [004.9295-009.4790]: It seems that uh- my-my bag didn't make it out on the carousel.
Ses02M_impro05_F001 [009.2950-013.2588]: Oh
Ses02M_impro05_M002 [011.4800-016.5042]: Yes
Ses02M_impro05_F002 [014.7400-016.4900]: Okay. Well
Ses02M_impro05_F003 [016.4900-027.9028]: Actually I'm looking here at the information
Ses02M_impro05_M003 [027.2271-031.5242]: Okay. So what-what do I have to get you know
Ses02M_impro05_F004 [030.4700-036.5507]: Well
Ses02M_impro05_M004 [035.3200-038.1932]: For some reason
Ses02M_impro05_F005 [038.1619-046.2674]: Well
Ses02M_impro05_F006 [046.2872-053.6683]: Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it.
Ses02M_impro05_M005 [053.6501-056.5535]: What? What? How does that happen?
Ses02M_impro05_F007 [056.6475-069.8700]: Um
Ses02M_impro05_M006 [067.2635-069.8172]: I really - I really need that bag.
Ses02M_impro05_F008 [069.8800-072.1149]: I- I- I understand
Ses02M_impro05_M007 [071.6500-074.4400]: there are- I have important things in that bag. I've got
Ses02M_impro05_F009 [074.3085-075.0407]: Okay
Ses02M_impro05_M008 [074.4500-081.9200]: I mean -- I've been away for a while and- and now I've- I've gifts for- for you know friends and family I mean
Ses02M_impro05_F010 [081.3600-082.5900]: Right.
Ses02M_impro05_M009 [081.9300-083.1741]: It's worth a lot.
Ses02M_impro05_F011 [083.1331-094.2758]: I understand that. Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage
Ses02M_impro05_M010 [094.0921-100.4500]: Not going to show - well isn't like - wouldn't it just be at the airport
Ses02M_impro05_M011 [100.4500-102.1519]: can they check there?
Ses02M_impro05_F012 [100.2715-104.9224]: Sometimes it gets stolen
Ses02M_impro05_M012 [104.6651-105.4765]: on another-
Ses02M_impro05_F013 [105.3994-111.5716]: they - they
Ses02M_impro05_F014 [111.7101-113.5505]: So we'll- what we'll do
Ses02M_impro05_M013 [112.1652-119.1800]: But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know
Ses02M_impro05_M014 [119.1900-121.8700]: see where it came from originally. I mean it seems like-
Ses02M_impro05_F015 [119.3685-125.5600]: Right. Like I said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim-reimburse you.
Ses02M_impro05_M015 [123.6628-124.5533]: Theft?
Ses02M_impro05_F016 [125.5900-127.1500]: Um
Ses02M_impro05_M016 [126.7989-133.6168]: Theft? Don't you know like all these people that are work - you keep like an eye on them
Ses02M_impro05_F017 [133.4189-141.7900]: We have very tight security but we -uh- there are times when we just can't uh make sure there aren't absolutely no human error
Ses02M_impro05_F018 [141.8000-145.1500]: I'm sorry there is no guarantee on baggage.
Ses02M_impro05_M017 [144.8700-148.0300]: This is unbelievable. I've got
Ses02M_impro05_M018 [148.0400-153.3268]: you don't realize the stuff that I've got in that - I really need to get the suitcase okay
Ses02M_impro05_F019 [152.8519-154.4152]: I understand
Ses02M_impro05_M019 [153.3268-157.4725]: so if it's back there or something
Ses02M_impro05_M020 [157.5352-161.3054]: I need you to tell me because I really need to get the bag
Ses02M_impro05_F020 [159.9100-162.6900]: all right
Ses02M_impro05_F021 [162.7000-165.6400]: and we will continue to look for it and because your paper-
Ses02M_impro05_M021 [165.1608-167.6344]: You've already checked? Can you check again? [garbage]
Ses02M_impro05_F022 [167.5717-176.8958]: I've already looked
Ses02M_impro05_M022 [176.6979-180.9525]: Fifty- fifty dollars? Come on you have got to be joking.
Ses02M_impro05_F023 [180.8041-187.9777]: Well
Ses02M_impro05_M023 [186.8406-196.4079]: Uh huh
Ses02M_impro05_M024 [196.4177-204.0663]: that might be like fifty dollars okay
Ses02M_impro05_F024 [203.0600-209.3303]: The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-
Ses02M_impro05_M025 [207.0300-211.9163]: The a- what? Talking about a core they can't afford it? I mean-
Ses02M_impro05_F025 [211.7643-217.8594]: Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have
Ses02M_impro05_F026 [217.8694-226.3700]: we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it
Ses02M_impro05_M026 [225.3600-230.8900]: I mean you're not helping me here. What do I have to do here? Do I need to sue the airline company is that what I should do
Ses02M_impro05_M027 [230.9000-233.3100]: because this is ridiculous?
Ses02M_impro05_F027 [230.9033-232.5628]: I'm sorry. I don't- I-
Ses02M_impro05_F028 [232.6200-241.2503]: I don't believe you should sue the airline company but we do have a policy uh- in which we can reimburse you and that's all we can do and I'm sorry I've done everything I can-
Ses02M_impro05_M028 [241.0860-245.8809]: All right. I'm sick- I'm sick of this all right. I'm sick of you and keep your fifty dollar.
Ses02M_impro05_F029 [242.5959-244.2978]: There's other people waiting-

Ses02M_script01_1_F000 [005.2300-008.7100]: What's he going to say
Ses02M_script01_1_M000 [008.3600-009.7900]: He saw it.
Ses02M_script01_1_F001 [009.4800-013.4500]: How could he see it? I was the first one up he was still in bed.
Ses02M_script01_1_M001 [013.2900-015.1400]: He was out here when it broke.
Ses02M_script01_1_F002 [014.9400-016.1300]: When?
Ses02M_script01_1_M002 [016.5400-024.3000]: About four this morning. I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked.
Ses02M_script01_1_F003 [025.2800-028.3300]: What was he doing out here at four in the morning?
Ses02M_script01_1_M003 [028.1700-033.9700]: I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen.
Ses02M_script01_1_F004 [033.6200-035.3700]: So you talked to him?
Ses02M_script01_1_M004 [034.9500-038.9700]: No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.
Ses02M_script01_1_F005 [038.9500-041.4000]: He cried hard?
Ses02M_script01_1_M005 [041.6600-044.6200]: I could hear him right through the floor in my room.
Ses02M_script01_1_F006 [044.3000-052.6700]: What was he doing out here at that hour? He's dreaming about him again
Ses02M_script01_1_M006 [052.4100-054.2600]: I guess he is.
Ses02M_script01_1_F007 [054.4100-059.8700]: He's getting just like after he died. What is the meaning of that?
Ses02M_script01_1_M007 [060.4400-067.2300]: I don't know the meaning of it
Ses02M_script01_1_F008 [066.8300-068.2200]: What?
Ses02M_script01_1_M008 [068.3800-073.2900]: Being dishonest with him. I mean that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.
Ses02M_script01_1_F009 [072.9900-074.8400]: What do you mean dishonest?
Ses02M_script01_1_M009 [074.8400-081.7200]: You know that Larry is not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?
Ses02M_script01_1_F010 [080.6700-083.4600]: What do you want to do
Ses02M_script01_1_M010 [082.8900-090.2400]: No I don't want to argue with him
Ses02M_script01_1_M011 [090.3500-102.4200]: Why -- why shouldn't he dream of him? Walk around
Ses02M_script01_1_F011 [101.0600-103.3900]: You can't say that to him.
Ses02M_script01_1_M012 [102.6600-104.4424]: We've got to say it to him.
Ses02M_script01_1_F012 [104.2300-106.6900]: Can you prove it
Ses02M_script01_1_M013 [106.0000-111.1700]: For God sakes it's been three years
Ses02M_script01_1_F013 [110.4300-117.7400]: To you it is and to me. You can talk yourself blue in the face but there is no body and no grave so where are you?
Ses02M_script01_1_M014 [117.8200-120.1400]: Sit down mom; I want to talk to you.
Ses02M_script01_1_F014 [119.7800-127.2100]: The trouble is the god damned newspapers
Ses02M_script01_1_M015 [126.0800-128.8200]: All right. All right. Listen to me.
Ses02M_script01_1_M016 [129.3200-133.2000]: You know why I brought Annie here don't you?
F: Why?
Ses02M_script01_1_M017 [134.9100-136.3200]: You know.
Ses02M_script01_1_F015 [136.0800-139.8400]: I got an idea but what's the story?
Ses02M_script01_1_M018 [140.6700-143.1000]: I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses02M_script01_1_F016 [143.5000-146.2500]: Well that's only your business
Ses02M_script01_1_M019 [145.8700-148.6100]: No it's not only my business.
Ses02M_script01_1_F017 [147.7500-151.5900]: What do you want me to do; you're old enough to know your own mind.
Ses02M_script01_1_M020 [151.8300-154.6200]: So it's all right then I'll go ahead with it?
Ses02M_script01_1_F018 [154.5400-158.0500]: Well
Ses02M_script01_1_M021 [156.4900-159.3200]: See it isn't just my business-
Ses02M_script01_1_F019 [158.3600-160.2000]: I'm just saying
Ses02M_script01_1_M022 [159.3900-170.0800]: Sometimes you infuriate me you know that. Isn't it your business to if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it? You have such a talent for ignoring things.
Ses02M_script01_1_F020 [168.8200-172.7800]: I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.
Ses02M_script01_1_M023 [172.3300-174.6500]: She's not Larry's girl.
Ses02M_script01_1_F021 [173.8500-179.0300]: From father's point of you he isn't dead and you have no right to take his girl.
Ses02M_script01_1_F022 [179.0400-186.7300]: You can go on from there if you know where to go but I don't know where to go
Ses02M_script01_1_M024 [186.3600-198.3700]: I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want
Ses02M_script01_1_F023 [197.4800-200.7200]: You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.
Ses02M_script01_1_M025 [199.8800-201.6200]: To hell with that.
Ses02M_script01_1_F024 [201.6700-204.1900]: Have you asked Annie yet?
Ses02M_script01_1_M026 [204.4600-206.8500]: I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses02M_script01_1_F025 [206.6200-210.6100]: How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.
Ses02M_script01_1_M027 [210.1900-215.6700]: Well
Ses02M_script01_1_M028 [215.8100-223.1100]: I don't know
Ses02M_script01_1_F026 [223.3200-227.1300]: Trouble is you don't see enough women
Ses02M_script01_1_M029 [226.9100-229.8400]: So what I'm not fast with women.
Ses02M_script01_1_F027 [229.7400-233.0900]: I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses02M_script01_1_M030 [233.4600-235.7600]: Because it is.
Ses02M_script01_1_F028 [235.9900-242.8200]: That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything. I mean you haven't seen her since you went away to war it's five years.
Ses02M_script01_1_M031 [242.4500-252.5900]: I can't help it I know her best. I mean lived next door to her my whole life. These years when I think of a wife
Ses02M_script01_1_M032 [252.6200-254.4900]: What do you want
Ses02M_script01_1_F029 [253.3200-260.8900]: I don't want a diagram. He thinks he's coming back. Chris
Ses02M_script01_1_F030 [260.9300-265.6000]: Do you know what's going to happen to your father because I don't
Ses02M_script01_1_M033 [264.4500-266.4300]: All right. All right. Mom.
Ses02M_script01_1_F031 [266.7900-269.2700]: Just give it some more thought.
Ses02M_script01_1_M034 [269.8100-279.6000]: I've given it three years of thought. I thought that if I waited
Ses02M_script01_1_M035 [279.6700-284.3700]: If I can't do that here well
Ses02M_script01_1_F032 [283.8200-286.2600]: What the hell is this?
Ses02M_script01_1_M036 [285.9200-290.9300]: I'll get out. I'll get married and go live some place else
Ses02M_script01_1_F033 [290.4400-293.2500]: What the hell is this
Ses02M_script01_1_M037 [292.8200-297.1700]: I've been a good son too long a good sucker
Ses02M_script01_1_F034 [296.6200-299.7000]: What about the business? What is this?
Ses02M_script01_1_M038 [298.9600-302.6900]: The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses02M_script01_1_F035 [301.4500-304.0400]: Must you be inspired?
Ses02M_script01_1_M039 [302.9900-310.2400]: Yes
Ses02M_script01_1_M040 [310.2700-320.7000]: I want a family; I want kids; I want something I can give myself to. Annie is in the middle of that. Now where do I find it?
Ses02M_script01_1_F036 [320.7100-323.5700]: Tell me
Ses02M_script01_1_M041 [323.6900-326.5200]: Yes
Ses02M_script01_1_F037 [326.6500-329.4100]: Well
Ses02M_script01_1_M042 [328.4300-330.7400]: Then help me stay here.
Ses02M_script01_1_F038 [329.6900-338.5800]: All right. But you don't want to be thinking like that 'cause otherwise what did we work for
Ses02M_script01_1_M043 [337.6200-342.1400]: I know I know mom. All right. Just help me stay here.
Ses02M_script01_1_F039 [342.3100-344.7800]: Just don't go thinking that way.
Ses02M_script01_1_M044 [344.4900-346.9700]: Well
Ses02M_script01_1_F040 [347.9200-350.8100]: I don't understand you
Ses02M_script01_1_M045 [351.0000-354.1800]: No
Ses02M_script01_1_F041 [354.1000-356.1800]: Yea
Ses02M_script01_2_F000 [005.9770-008.3300]: Why did he invite her here?
Ses02M_script01_2_M000 [007.8900-009.7200]: Why does that bother you?
Ses02M_script01_2_F001 [009.3600-013.4500]: She's been in New York three and half years why all of a sudden-
Ses02M_script01_2_M001 [012.4800-015.5400]: Well
Ses02M_script01_2_F002 [015.2100-018.3800]: Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
Ses02M_script01_2_M002 [018.3200-023.9100]: What do you mean? He lived next door to the girl all his life
Ses02M_script01_2_M003 [024.5300-028.5200]: Don't look at me like that
Ses02M_script01_2_F003 [028.3000-030.6300]: He's not going to marry her.
Ses02M_script01_2_M004 [030.2400-032.4200]: How do you know he's even thinking of it?
Ses02M_script01_2_F004 [031.6500-034.3900]: It's got that all about it.
Ses02M_script01_2_M005 [035.3700-037.1900]: Well
Ses02M_script01_2_F005 [036.9700-039.2200]: What's going on here Joe?
Ses02M_script01_2_M006 [038.4200-040.5500]: All right. Now
Ses02M_script01_2_F006 [039.4500-043.0300]: -She's not his girl Joe; she knows she's not.
Ses02M_script01_2_M007 [042.5500-044.6300]: You can't read her mind.
Ses02M_script01_2_F007 [044.2400-053.7400]: Then why is she still single
Ses02M_script01_2_M008 [053.1400-055.5200]: How do you know why she has waited?
Ses02M_script01_2_F008 [055.1800-064.1800]: She knows what I know
Ses02M_script01_2_M009 [064.7300-067.7300]: Look it's a nice day
Ses02M_script01_2_F009 [066.8300-074.3800]: Nobody in this house dares take her faith away Joe. Strangers might
Ses02M_script01_2_M010 [073.6100-076.2000]: What do you want me to do about it?
Ses02M_script01_2_F010 [074.8400-083.0600]: I want you to act like he's coming back
Ses02M_script01_2_M011 [082.6000-084.5100]: But Kate
Ses02M_script01_2_F011 [083.1600-088.6400]: Because if he's not coming back
Ses02M_script01_2_F012 [088.6500-096.1700]: why did that happen the very night she came back she sleeps in his room and suddenly his memorial breaks to pieces
Ses02M_script01_2_M012 [094.9900-096.8700]: Calm yourself.
Ses02M_script01_2_F013 [096.1900-099.8300]: I need you to believe with me; I can't stand all alone.
Ses02M_script01_2_M013 [099.1400-100.9000]: Calm yourself.
Ses02M_script01_2_F014 [099.9000-105.8100]: Even last week there was a man who showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry
Ses02M_script01_2_M014 [104.6400-107.3800]: All right. All right. Calm yourself.
Ses02M_script01_2_F015 [106.2000-109.4400]: Just you above all need to believe.
Ses02M_script01_2_M015 [108.7200-111.2800]: Wait
Ses02M_script01_2_F016 [111.0700-113.6500]: Don't stop believing.
Ses02M_script01_2_M016 [113.2400-115.9300]: What does that mean
Ses02M_script01_2_M017 [116.1000-118.8100]: Look at you -- look at you shaking.
Ses02M_script01_2_F017 [118.0500-120.1100]: I can't help it.
Ses02M_script01_2_M018 [119.4000-124.3700]: What have I got to hide? What the hell is the matter with you
Ses02M_script01_3_F000 [006.2437-009.9782]: You're the only one I know who loves his parents.
Ses02M_script01_3_M000 [009.3460-012.5191]: I know
Ses02M_script01_3_F001 [011.9104-014.3718]: It's all right.  It's a good thing.
Ses02M_script01_3_F002 [014.4248-019.5330]: You know
Ses02M_script01_3_M001 [019.5594-022.4179]: You're not sorry you came?
Ses02M_script01_3_F003 [021.5974-028.9819]: No
Ses02M_script01_3_M002 [028.6907-030.9140]: Why?
Ses02M_script01_3_F004 [030.2788-034.9370]: For one thing
Ses02M_script01_3_M003 [034.1165-036.3133]: Oh.
Ses02M_script01_3_F005 [035.0164-041.9509]: You saw that.  I mean and then
Ses02M_script01_3_M004 [041.2628-043.6713]: What?
Ses02M_script01_3_F006 [042.7185-048.9383]: Well
Ses02M_script01_3_M005 [048.5942-061.0604]: The trouble is
Ses02M_script01_3_F007 [059.9223-063.4160]: I knew they would
Ses02M_script01_3_M006 [062.5955-064.6335]: How'd you know?
Ses02M_script01_3_F008 [064.1042-067.9419]: Well
Ses02M_script01_3_M007 [066.5392-076.0410]: Oh.  Would you want to?  I guess you know
Ses02M_script01_3_F009 [075.8028-080.5934]: I guess this is why I came.
Ses02M_script01_3_M008 [079.8788-089.7511]: Ann
Ses02M_script01_3_M009 [089.8305-094.0124]: I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.
Ses02M_script01_3_M010 [094.0653-104.2024]: I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.
Ses02M_script01_3_M011 [104.3082-115.0540]: You feel wrong here
Ses02M_script01_3_F010 [113.3072-117.2243]: Oh
Ses02M_script01_3_M012 [116.5891-120.3475]: And he's gone forever.  You're sure?
Ses02M_script01_3_F011 [119.4741-123.4971]: I almost got married two years ago.
Ses02M_script01_3_M013 [122.5972-125.1910]: Why didn't you?
Ses02M_script01_3_F012 [124.4235-128.2083]: Well
Ses02M_script01_3_M014 [127.0438-130.5904]: You felt something that far back?
Ses02M_script01_3_F013 [129.5846-131.7814]: Every day since.
Ses02M_script01_3_M015 [131.9138-134.7458]: Ann
Ses02M_script01_3_F014 [133.5283-143.4007]: Well
Ses02M_script01_3_M016 [142.7654-146.1268]: Give me a kiss
Ses02M_script01_3_M017 [146.2499-153.9347]: God
Ses02M_script01_3_F015 [152.2937-161.3721]: I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  I mean
Ses02M_script01_3_M018 [160.2604-164.1776]: Oh
Ses02M_script01_3_F016 [162.8542-165.6598]: Not like that you're not.
Ses02M_script01_3_M019 [164.7599-166.9832]: I kissed you.
Ses02M_script01_3_F017 [165.9774-172.4090]: Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you
Ses02M_script01_3_M020 [172.5943-176.9085]: Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.
Ses02M_script01_3_F018 [174.8175-179.8463]: No.  What is it
Ses02M_script01_3_M021 [179.6875-183.1283]: No.  Nothing like that.
Ses02M_script01_3_F019 [182.4666-192.0214]: Well
Ses02M_script01_3_M022 [190.9891-196.8120]: Yeah
Ses02M_script01_3_F020 [196.0709-199.7234]: You've gotta tell me.
Ses02M_script01_3_M023 [199.9881-203.1642]: I don't know how to start.
Ses02M_script01_3_F021 [202.2113-206.0226]: It wouldn't work this way.
Ses02M_script01_3_M024 [206.0226-214.3334]: It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas
Ses02M_script01_3_F022 [213.7247-216.0803]: Yeah
Ses02M_script01_3_M025 [216.3450-220.2621]: Well
Ses02M_script01_3_F023 [220.0504-223.1206]: How many?
Ses02M_script01_3_M026 [222.9618-226.0585]: Just about all.
Ses02M_script01_3_F024 [225.3174-228.1494]: gee.
Ses02M_script01_3_M027 [227.3025-234.5281]: It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.
Ses02M_script01_3_M028 [234.6340-249.8263]: For instance
Ses02M_script01_3_M029 [249.9322-260.0957]: They didn't die
Ses02M_script01_3_M030 [260.1751-276.8495]: I got this idea watching 'em go down.  Everything was being destroyed
Ses02M_script01_3_M031 [276.9290-289.3951]: To show that
Ses02M_script01_3_M032 [289.5539-310.0662]: Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean
Ses02M_script01_3_M033 [310.1721-332.6959]: And I felt what you said
Ses02M_script01_3_M034 [332.7753-346.0090]: I mean
Ses02M_script01_3_M035 [346.0355-360.1426]: Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of that.  And I guess that included you.
Ses02M_script01_3_F025 [359.3486-362.8688]: Do you still feel that way?
Ses02M_script01_3_M036 [363.0540-366.5213]: I want you now Annie.
Ses02M_script01_3_F026 [365.3567-374.8585]: 'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything you have
Ses02M_script01_3_F027 [374.9644-383.4604]: I mean
Ses02M_script01_3_M037 [382.9311-388.3834]: I know Annie.  I'm gonna make a fortune for you.
Ses02M_script01_3_F028 [387.7482-391.1095]: What'll I do with a fortune?
Ses02M_script02_1_M000 [004.9300-008.2800]: What time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight.
Ses02M_script02_1_M001 [008.3600-012.7800]: God
Ses02M_script02_1_M002 [013.1700-019.0800]: I would have wanted to go a little further up the coast
Ses02M_script02_1_M003 [019.1100-020.5400]: How you doing?
Ses02M_script02_1_F000 [020.1900-021.5800]: Fine.
Ses02M_script02_1_M004 [021.9200-028.1800]: Is that -- is that
Ses02M_script02_1_M005 [028.3900-034.0000]: Although
Ses02M_script02_1_M006 [034.4100-043.2700]: How you doing? You know what I forgot? I forgot to bring my flashlight. How - how could I forget to bring my flashlight? How could I be so stupid?
Ses02M_script02_1_F001 [042.8600-044.9500]: What flashlight?
Ses02M_script02_1_M007 [045.2400-048.4500]: You know the flashlight
Ses02M_script02_1_F002 [048.0000-049.8300]: That's not your flashlight.
Ses02M_script02_1_M008 [050.4000-051.7500]: Who's is it?
Ses02M_script02_1_F003 [051.4000-053.8400]: It's ours; it's mine too.
Ses02M_script02_1_M009 [053.5400-055.8100]: Oh well
Ses02M_script02_1_F004 [054.9500-060.1700]: But you kept saying my flashlight as if somehow it's just yours. I mean how is it supposed to make me feel?
Ses02M_script02_1_M010 [059.6100-066.0400]: No. No. Of course our flashlight yours and mine. Mi flashlight
Ses02M_script02_1_M011 [066.0700-071.2900]: How could we forget to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.
Ses02M_script02_1_M012 [071.5900-076.8800]: I wonder do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year
Ses02M_script02_1_F005 [076.5300-078.2700]: Yea.
Ses02M_script02_1_M013 [078.2894-085.7500]: You cold
Ses02M_script02_1_M014 [085.8700-092.4100]: Oh
Ses02M_script02_1_M015 [092.4252-097.2200]: oh man. Like a kid
Ses02M_script02_1_M016 [099.7938-106.1000]: You think they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?
Ses02M_script02_1_F006 [105.7900-107.4100]: I'm cold.
Ses02M_script02_1_M017 [107.5200-109.1900]: What you want my jacket?
Ses02M_script02_1_F007 [108.9900-111.6800]: It's after eleven. Let's just go home.
Ses02M_script02_1_M018 [111.7800-117.1300]: Are you kidding
Ses02M_script02_1_F008 [116.8100-119.0500]: There is no point in coming down here.
Ses02M_script02_1_M019 [118.7400-119.8500]: Right.
Ses02M_script02_1_F009 [119.4700-121.1500]: That's my point.
Ses02M_script02_1_M020 [120.7400-122.4200]: That's my point too.
Ses02M_script02_1_F010 [122.0800-124.0800]: So let's go.
Ses02M_script02_1_M021 [124.1000-132.9100]: No. No. That's not my point. The point is there is no point in coming down here if we just leave. Don't you want to see it?
Ses02M_script02_1_F011 [132.7100-134.5600]: Not particularly.
Ses02M_script02_1_M022 [134.6400-136.1200]: Why not?
Ses02M_script02_1_F012 [136.1000-139.0000]: I don't
Ses02M_script02_1_M023 [138.7700-143.9600]: Honey
Ses02M_script02_1_M024 [143.9900-152.0100]: Think about the people in Kansas
Ses02M_script02_1_F013 [151.2700-158.2600]: Pass up what? These little fish swim onto the beach flop around and swim away
Ses02M_script02_1_M025 [158.0100-168.1327]: Yea
Ses02M_script02_1_M026 [168.1740-171.5500]: This is a big night for these guys
Ses02M_script02_1_F014 [170.6400-178.5700]: What are you so excited about? I mean it's not a moon landing we're talking about here it's fish. It's a fish nobody even eats.
Ses02M_script02_1_M027 [178.6400-180.0900]: Yes they do.
Ses02M_script02_1_F015 [179.7400-180.9100]: Augie
Ses02M_script02_1_M028 [180.4600-190.4100]: Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano
Ses02M_script02_1_M029 [190.4400-198.2500]: you know there is like
Ses02M_script02_1_F016 [197.3700-199.0000]: I'm just not.
Ses02M_script02_1_M030 [199.1400-200.3600]: For real?
Ses02M_script02_1_F017 [200.0900-201.0800]: Yes.
Ses02M_script02_1_M031 [201.7700-206.6400]: I don't get it. The first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life.
Ses02M_script02_1_M032 [206.7100-215.3500]: And then last year I remember specifically you were so excited that you stubbed your toe on the way pushing me out of the house
Ses02M_script02_1_F018 [214.7200-224.9700]: Last year you'll also remember our shoes got wet
Ses02M_script02_1_M033 [225.1800-227.2300]: We weren't in a good spot.
Ses02M_script02_1_F019 [226.4700-228.4800]: We didn't see them the first time either.
Ses02M_script02_1_M034 [228.1900-234.6100]: We just weren't in a good spot; this is a much better spot. I've got good instincts for these things.
Ses02M_script02_1_M035 [235.0000-240.1200]: There is that
Ses02M_script02_1_M036 [240.1400-249.8600]: This is
Ses02M_script02_1_M037 [250.6700-255.4100]: Out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way
Ses02M_script02_1_M038 [255.4800-264.0400]: they don't why
Ses02M_script02_1_M039 [264.1100-282.9385]: Just all as one. This little time sensitive firecracker
Ses02M_script02_1_M040 [282.9700-294.5000]: It's single mindedness
Ses02M_script02_1_M041 [294.9900-304.3800]: they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand
Ses02M_script02_1_M042 [304.4400-307.9100]: Look at me; I'm giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up.
Ses02M_script02_1_F020 [307.2600-308.7900]: That's the wind.
Ses02M_script02_1_M043 [309.9600-311.5100]: Well
Ses02M_script02_1_F021 [311.5800-312.9100]: About what?
Ses02M_script02_1_M044 [312.9600-314.5700]: What I was saying.
Ses02M_script02_1_F022 [314.6700-316.8300]: It's ridiculous.
Ses02M_script02_2_M000 [003.8800-005.8600]: So what do you think?
Ses02M_script02_2_F000 [005.3800-007.1300]: About what?
Ses02M_script02_2_M001 [006.8800-008.7300]: What I was saying.
Ses02M_script02_2_F001 [008.4200-010.3700]: It's ridiculous.
Ses02M_script02_2_M002 [010.1200-014.9000]: Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
Ses02M_script02_2_F002 [013.9900-020.9200]: It's PR. Someone sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.
Ses02M_script02_2_M003 [020.3400-023.4600]: Well
Ses02M_script02_2_F003 [022.7300-034.9900]: Yea
Ses02M_script02_2_M004 [035.3200-037.3700]: Are we talking about the same thing?
Ses02M_script02_2_F004 [036.6700-039.6200]: I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.
Ses02M_script02_2_M005 [039.4900-046.9800]: Carla
Ses02M_script02_2_F005 [046.5600-054.3700]: Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.
Ses02M_script02_2_M006 [053.3600-055.2400]: Well
Ses02M_script02_2_F006 [054.8300-059.2000]: We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.
Ses02M_script02_2_M007 [058.7900-068.1500]: There is nothing to it
Ses02M_script02_2_F007 [067.3500-070.4600]: For heavens sake we are not going to see the Grunions.
Ses02M_script02_2_M008 [069.7800-071.1000]: Why not?
Ses02M_script02_2_F008 [070.6300-073.8700]: We never do
Ses02M_script02_2_M009 [073.4600-076.0100]: We've missed them twice; that's not ever.
Ses02M_script02_2_F009 [075.6100-078.9900]: Twice is every time we've tried
Ses02M_script02_2_M010 [078.8100-081.0100]: Well
Ses02M_script02_2_F010 [080.1500-086.1393]: No we won't; it's pointless. It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus
Ses02M_script02_2_F011 [086.1688-098.2000]: I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up.
Ses02M_script02_2_M011 [098.1200-100.0900]: I thought you wanted to see them.
Ses02M_script02_2_F012 [100.1400-103.2700]: You don't understand anything I'm saying.
Ses02M_script02_2_M012 [102.5100-104.4400]: No of course not.
Ses02M_script02_2_F013 [103.7200-110.2900]: I did want to see them
Ses02M_script02_2_M013 [110.8200-113.8100]: It's just fish
Ses02M_script02_2_F014 [112.3100-115.3200]: For heavens sake this isn't about fish.
Ses02M_script02_2_M014 [114.9200-123.0200]: All right. I've been trying to work this backwards but I cannot seem to pinpoint the moment that we took a turn for the worst.
Ses02M_script02_2_M015 [123.3300-135.1800]: You were fine during the phone call from Marge
Ses02M_script02_2_M016 [135.1900-139.7100]: "the Grunion are running tonight
Ses02M_script03_1_M000 [005.5365-007.2541]: Good God.
Ses02M_script03_1_F000 [006.7608-008.6428]: Do you think it's them?
Ses02M_script03_1_M001 [008.1099-009.5667]: I wonder.
Ses02M_script03_1_F001 [009.1462-012.2099]: Well
Ses02M_script03_1_M002 [011.5341-013.4564]: Must be them then.
Ses02M_script03_1_F002 [013.0059-015.7092]: What are we going to do?
Ses02M_script03_1_M003 [016.2649-019.1183]: We're all right darling
Ses02M_script03_1_F003 [018.5326-020.8905]: Now and always sweet.
Ses02M_script03_1_M004 [020.3799-022.0920]: I don't care then.
Ses02M_script03_1_F004 [021.3711-024.1945]: It's bound to come sooner or later.
Ses02M_script03_1_M005 [023.7318-030.3521]: Hello? Hello? What? Wrong number.
Ses02M_script03_1_F005 [029.3458-033.1455]: Oh. It sends shivers down my spine.
Ses02M_script03_1_M006 [032.3946-035.4283]: What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us?
Ses02M_script03_1_F006 [034.9176-037.6510]: Behave exquisitely.
Ses02M_script03_1_M007 [036.8550-038.9426]: With the most perfect poise.
Ses02M_script03_1_F007 [038.1466-042.2165]: Yes
Ses02M_script03_1_M008 [041.7810-046.2415]: Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's is happy
Ses02M_script03_1_F008 [045.7158-049.1550]: What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.
Ses02M_script03_1_M009 [048.3140-050.2964]: Oh darling don't say that.
Ses02M_script03_1_F009 [049.6807-053.3001]: It's true; the whole business is a very poor joke.
Ses02M_script03_1_M010 [052.7895-056.4840]: Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love?
Ses02M_script03_1_F010 [055.8532-058.0008]: Yes. Meaning just that.
Ses02M_script03_1_M011 [057.8506-066.9518]: What does it all mean that's what I ask- that's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth?  Good God what does it all mean?
Ses02M_script03_1_F011 [065.7202-068.3785]: Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.
Ses02M_script03_1_M012 [067.6426-070.7814]: You mustn't be serious my dear one
Ses02M_script03_1_F012 [070.1807-071.6825]: Who's they?
Ses02M_script03_1_M013 [071.0668-079.0343]: All those futile moralists
Ses02M_script03_1_M014 [079.0941-083.0664]: flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light.
Ses02M_script03_1_F013 [082.1503-085.5445]: Well
Ses02M_script03_1_M015 [084.8536-088.1727]: Certainly you must
Ses02M_script03_1_F014 [087.6921-091.4166]: Well
Ses02M_script03_1_M016 [090.8309-094.6456]: No
Ses02M_script03_1_F015 [094.2401-096.7481]: Oh dear
Ses02M_script03_1_M017 [096.2375-098.7456]: Depends on how well we play it.
Ses02M_script03_1_F016 [098.2650-103.4163]: Well
Ses02M_script03_1_M018 [102.7104-105.5789]: Yes
Ses02M_script03_1_F017 [105.1884-107.5613]: Well that's serious enough
Ses02M_script03_1_M019 [106.7203-112.7727]: No
Ses02M_script03_1_F018 [112.2020-115.3408]: Darling
Ses02M_script03_1_M020 [114.7701-117.3683]: So is everyone else in the long run.
Ses02M_script03_1_M021 [117.3833-131.0900]: Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers
Ses02M_script03_1_M022 [131.1199-135.9153]: Come kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
Ses02M_script03_1_F019 [135.4354-138.0486]: Elliot
Ses02M_script03_1_M023 [137.4478-149.5226]: I don't care what you do see. You can paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome
Ses02M_script03_1_F020 [148.4863-155.8903]: Thank you dear
Ses02M_script03_1_M024 [155.2896-158.9541]: You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
Ses02M_script03_1_F021 [157.9779-160.6512]: Which particular one?
Ses02M_script03_1_M025 [160.2156-165.2468]: The one when you bought that little
Ses02M_script03_1_F022 [164.1655-169.3167]: Oh Charles
Ses02M_script03_1_M026 [168.7310-170.9537]: Horrible thing
Ses02M_script03_1_F023 [169.9475-176.6757]: I know you did. You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal; I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
Ses02M_script03_1_M027 [176.0149-178.2226]: How long did that row last?
Ses02M_script03_1_F024 [177.4867-180.2651]: It went on intermittently for days.
Ses02M_script03_1_M028 [179.9197-185.0409]: The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burned a hole in my new dressing gown.
Ses02M_script03_1_F025 [183.4941-188.0446]: It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
Ses02M_script03_1_M029 [186.7230-189.3062]: That was a rouser
Ses02M_script03_1_F026 [188.6003-191.8743]: That was the first time you ever hit me.
Ses02M_script03_1_M030 [191.3336-193.7366]: I didn't hit you very hard.
Ses02M_script03_1_F027 [192.7754-200.6450]: The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.
Ses02M_script03_1_M031 [199.3084-201.8314]: I'll never forget his face.
Ses02M_script03_1_F028 [200.7651-205.3307]: Oh it was ridiculous
Ses02M_script03_1_M032 [204.6399-207.0278]: We were very much younger then.
Ses02M_script03_1_F029 [206.4871-209.2956]: And very much sillier.
Ses02M_script03_1_M033 [208.7249-213.5908]: As a matter of fact the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses02M_script03_2_M000 [003.3467-007.2362]: As a matter of fact
Ses02M_script03_2_F000 [006.1870-009.2081]: You knew there was nothing in that.
Ses02M_script03_2_M001 [008.0684-011.7227]: I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.
Ses02M_script03_2_F001 [010.8543-013.8031]: Presents
Ses02M_script03_2_M002 [012.8624-019.3026]: Yes
Ses02M_script03_2_F002 [017.8192-022.7036]: No it wasn't. It was very pretty I still have it and I wear it often.
Ses02M_script03_2_M003 [021.6905-025.8152]: You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses02M_script03_2_F003 [024.2956-028.6373]: No I didn't
Ses02M_script03_2_M004 [027.8413-031.3147]: You must admit he was in love with you
Ses02M_script03_2_F004 [030.3559-033.9378]: Just a little perhaps
Ses02M_script03_2_M005 [033.4132-036.0725]: You let him kiss you; you said you did.
Ses02M_script03_2_F005 [035.0775-036.6876]: What of it?
Ses02M_script03_2_M006 [036.3258-037.8815]: What of it?
Ses02M_script03_2_F006 [037.1398-040.1248]: It gave him a lot of pleasure
Ses02M_script03_2_M007 [039.4011-041.4815]: What about me?
Ses02M_script03_2_F007 [040.7398-045.6966]: Well
Ses02M_script03_2_M008 [045.0092-047.8675]: That's a nice point of view I must say.
Ses02M_script03_2_F008 [047.2886-050.2012]: I'm bored of this conversation.
Ses02M_script03_2_M009 [049.6404-054.3077]: Yes
Ses02M_script03_2_F009 [053.9821-055.8816]: No thanks.
Ses02M_script03_2_M010 [055.2122-057.5821]: I have a little I think.
Ses02M_script03_2_F010 [057.0756-061.8515]: I don't see why you want any you've already had two glasses.
Ses02M_script03_2_M011 [061.3268-065.5419]: No particular reason. Anyhow
Ses02M_script03_2_F011 [064.8002-069.1600]: It just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.
Ses02M_script03_2_M012 [068.5630-075.2204]: You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.
Ses02M_script03_2_F012 [074.1892-076.9751]: Well
Ses02M_script03_2_M013 [076.3601-080.9912]: You needn't be so grand just because don't happen want any yourself right now.
Ses02M_script03_2_F013 [079.6525-081.9681]: Don't be so stupid.
Ses02M_script03_2_M014 [081.0817-083.0716]: Really
Ses02M_script03_2_F014 [082.0767-083.3611]: What?
Ses02M_script03_2_M015 [083.1621-084.8626]: Nothing.
Ses02M_script03_2_F015 [090.8144-095.7350]: No I'm just making myself fascinating for you.
Ses02M_script03_2_M016 [088.2093-091.1400]: Going out somewhere
Ses02M_script03_2_F016 [097.3451-100.5290]: It's a woman's job to allure the man
Ses02M_script03_2_M017 [094.8847-098.2496]: That reply has broken my heart.
Ses02M_script03_2_F017 [100.5652-102.8988]: watch me a minute
Ses02M_script03_2_M018 [102.3380-105.6305]: As a matter of fact
Ses02M_script03_2_F018 [104.8345-106.6979]: Oh
Ses02M_script03_2_M019 [106.4244-107.1144]: Yes it is.
Ses02M_script03_2_F019 [106.7159-108.4345]: Be quiet.
Ses02M_script03_2_M020 [107.9461-112.5230]: It's a pity you didn't have any more Brandy it might have made you a little less disagreeable.
Ses02M_script03_2_F020 [111.4376-114.2054]: It doesn't seem to work such wonders with you.
Ses02M_script03_2_M021 [113.6265-116.6295]: Snap
Ses02M_script03_2_F021 [116.3039-118.6557]: Adders don't snap they sting.
Ses02M_script03_2_M022 [117.7331-121.9120]: Oh nonsense they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.
Ses02M_script03_2_F022 [121.4235-122.7622]: They sting.
Ses02M_script03_2_M023 [121.9662-123.7391]: They snap.
Ses02M_script03_2_F023 [122.7984-129.6366]: I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.
Ses02M_script03_2_M024 [129.4014-133.6165]: Tell me
Ses02M_script03_2_F024 [133.1281-136.6919]: Yes
Ses02M_script03_2_M025 [135.7693-139.6407]: I imagine you let him kiss you good deal more then.
Ses02M_script03_2_F025 [138.6095-140.7623]: Mind your own business.
Ses02M_script03_2_M026 [140.1110-143.1502]: What riotous time you must have had.
Ses02M_script03_2_M027 [143.1864-147.0035]: No restraint at all
Ses02M_script03_2_F026 [146.1171-150.3864]: You're quite insufferable. I expect it's because you're drunk.
Ses02M_script03_2_M028 [149.3372-152.6839]: I am not in the least drunk.
Ses02M_script03_2_M029 [155.1442-164.9131]: I imagine
Ses02M_script03_2_F027 [163.5925-169.4719]: On the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of Brandy.
Ses02M_script03_2_M030 [168.1513-173.7775]: Oh very interesting. How about a child of four
Ses02M_script03_2_F028 [172.6559-174.8086]: Oh be quiet.
Ses02M_script03_2_M031 [174.0307-178.7343]: We can get a good little debate going about that
Ses02M_script03_2_F029 [177.8659-181.5202]: Not very funny my dear
Ses02M_script03_2_M032 [180.9956-183.6368]: All right. I will.
Ses02M_script03_2_M033 [185.5182-187.6529]: Better turn that off I think.
Ses02M_script03_2_F030 [187.2368-189.1725]: Why?
Ses02M_script03_2_M034 [188.4489-192.1755]: Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs.
Ses02M_script03_2_F031 [191.2348-195.5404]: There aren't any people upstairs it's a photographer's studio.
Ses02M_script03_2_M035 [194.9253-197.8379]: There are people downstairs I suppose?
Ses02M_script03_2_F032 [196.8791-199.3936]: They're away in Tunis.
Ses02M_script03_2_M036 [198.9052-202.5595]: This is no time of the year for Tunis.
Ses02M_script03_2_F033 [201.7273-204.6218]: Turn it on again
Ses02M_script03_2_M037 [203.7173-206.3947]: I'll do no such thing.

Ses02M_script03_2_M038 [210.4289-213.3414]: Turn it off it's driving me mad.
Ses02M_script03_2_F035 [212.1475-216.3264]: You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.
Ses02M_script03_2_M039 [215.3314-217.0862]: Turn it off.
Ses02M_script03_2_F036 [216.3625-218.4471]: Stop it. Stop it. I hate you.
Ses02M_script03_2_M040 [217.1224-219.7817]: Amanda
Ses02M_script03_2_F037 [218.4791-224.3586]: Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you
Ses02M_script03_2_M041 [223.2008-225.6611]: Very amusing indeed.
Ses02M_script03_2_F038 [224.4490-230.9616]: Stop it. Stop it. I hate you
Ses02M_script03_2_M042 [230.2018-236.6782]: You're a vile tempered
Ses02M_script03_2_F039 [235.8460-240.0792]: This is the end
Ses02M_script03_2_M043 [239.3375-241.4722]: You're not going like this.
Ses02M_script03_2_F040 [240.4772-242.5757]: Oh yes I am.
Ses02M_script03_2_M044 [241.6531-243.4983]: You're not.

Ses02M_script03_2_M046 [245.4159-246.5737]: Shut up.
Ses02M_script03_2_M047 [248.1838-257.9346]: I wouldn't marry you again if you came to me on your bended knees. You're a evil minded little vampire. I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.
Ses02M_script03_2_F042 [254.0651-257.9526]: You're a beast. I hate you. Stop it. Stop it.
